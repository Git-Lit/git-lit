12 FIRST SETTLEMENT IN CASCO BAY. 163 6 1644 pounds. The number of the colonists assessed to pay the amount, was twenty-one. The whole number of people who composed the settlement, at this period, was about one hundred and sixty. The system adopted in his government by Gorges, was, to retain the power in his own hands and appoint, of his own selection, a council of seven, and also to provide for a branch, consisting of representatives cho sen by the people. He prepared a transcript of his charter and commissioned councillors to execute then trust and read their instructions to the people, that they might know how they were governed. The com mission, under Ms hand and seal, is dated September 2, 1639. His permanent councillors were as follows : Thomas Gorges,1 Deputy Governor ; Richard Vines, of Saco ; Henry Joscelyn, of Black Point ; Francis Charn pernoon, of Piscataqua ; Richard Bonython, of Saco ; William Hook, of Agamenticus, and Edward Godfrey, of Piscataqua, [Kittery] Thomas Gorges, after the expiration of his mission, which expired in 1644, returned to England. The success of republican principles in the mother country, induced Alexander Rigby — a man of piety and wealth — to become the purchaser of this grant. According ly, in April, 1643, he took possession of the country. He commissioned George Cleaves,2 who had lived for thirteen years at Spurwink, and on the neck at Fal- i Thomas Gorges was a cousin to Sir Ferdinando. Champemoon was his nephew. The latter died in 1687. Two of Ids daughters married broth- ers by the name of Cutts. Another married Humphrey Elliot. 2 In the year 1630, George Cleaves, in connection with Richard Tucker, carried on business at the mouth of Spurwink river, Cape Elizabeth. As the friend of Cleaves, Tucker took a deep interest in his affairs, and when the difficulty arose between Vines and Cleaves, the former used Tucker roughly on his visit to Saco and threw him in prison.
