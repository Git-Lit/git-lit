15 FIRST SETTLEMENT IN CASCO BAY. 1664 1669 1674 sea coast — up the Pemaquid to its head — thence to the Kennebec river, in a northerly course to the river St. Lawrence. This part of New England was annex ed to the government of New York, and called the Duke of York's property. On the death of Charles II. his brother became James II. ; but upon his abdica tion these tracts reverted to the crown. Upon the res toration, the heirs of Gorges1 made complaint to the crown of the Massachusetts usurpation. In 1665, the king's commissioners visited New England — came to Maine and appomted officers independent of the Mas sachusetts colony. These magistrates admmistered government according to the instructions given them by the king's commissioners, until the year 1668 or 1669, when the general court appomted and sent commissioners and mterrupted those who had been ap pointed by the king's authority. The public affairs were in much confusion : some de claring for the heirs of Gorges and the king, and oth ers for Massachusetts. The latter finally prevafled, and courts of pleas and criminal jurisdiction were held in the province of Maine. In the year 1674, the heirs of Gorges agam made complaint to the king of the ursurpation of Massachu setts Bay, and the people were called to answer to the complaint, The consequence was, for a time, they ceased to exercise then authority, and the grandson of Gorges sent over instructions. In the year 1677, the i Sir Ferdinando Gorges died in England, 1648, at the age of 74. His eldest son John, to whom fell his es- tate, through incapacity, or not think- ing that he should prove successful in his efforts, took no care whatever of the property. It was a grandson of Sir Ferdinando, who now made com plaint to the king.
