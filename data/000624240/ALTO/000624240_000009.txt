Vines performed several voyages in the employ of Gorges ; but for how many years we are not informed. In 1635, Sir Ferdinando obtained a grant from the council of Plymouth, of all the land lying between the rivers Piscataqua and Sagadahock — the mouth of the Kennebec, and so far up the river as to make a square of one hundred and twenty miles. Sir Ferdinando ob tained from the king a charter of the soil and jurisdic tion over it. The crown never granted to any subject more powers than were given to Gorges.1 He enjoined little else than the establishment of the Episcopal forms of church government. Of the whole province Gorges was made Lord Palatine, with the same privi leges and powers as the Bishop of Durham, in the county of Palatine of Durham. To administer justice to the people, Sir Ferdinando, in 1636, sent over his nephew, William Gorges, to act in the capacity of Governor ; a man every way quali fied for his office. It was in Saco2 that he entered up on his duties. At this time this was the oldest and the most flourishing settlement in the Province. In the mean time Mr. Vines had acted as Governor, with the assistance of Richard Bonython.
