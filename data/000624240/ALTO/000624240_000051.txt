53 GEORGE BURROUGHS. 16 92 of Boston ; Hannah married Mr. Fox, of the same place ; but we know not the name of the husband of Mary ; and Elizabeth married Peter Thomas, of Bos ton, the ancestor of the late Isaiah Thomas,1 L L. D. of Worcester. The names of his two sons were George and Jeremiah. i Isaiah Thomas was the son of Mo- ses Thomas. He was born in Boston in 1749. His father died when he was young. At the age of six years he was put out as an apprentice to Z. Fowle, with whom he remained eleven years. In 1770, he commenced in Boston the publication of the Massa- chusetts Spy, in which paper he pub- lished many spirited articles against the oppressive laws of the British Par- liament towards the New England Colonies. In 1771, Governor Hutch- inson and Council, on account of an article that appeared in the Spy, en- deavored to bring 5Mr. Thomas before them — but so much resistance was made that' the measure was finally dropped. In 1775, he removed his paper to Worcester, and three years after opened a bookstore in Boston. At one time he had under his control sixteen presses in use and eight book- stores. He issued a folio edition of the Bible in 1791. In the latter part of his life, Mr. Thomas founded the American Antiquarian Society, for which he erected a brick house at Worcester — of which society he was president and a most liberal patron. The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him by the Alleghany College, Pennsylvania. He published in 1810, in two volumes, oc- tavo, a valuable History of Printing in America, which evinces great re- search. He died at Worcester, April 4, 1831, aged 82 years.
