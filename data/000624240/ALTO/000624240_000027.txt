29 CHRONICLES OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FOUR. 1804 March appointed to succeed him. Although Mr. Granger1 believes ' that the public interest will be promoted by the appomtment of a new Postmaster,' he flatters himself that the public will not tMnk that his belief is grounded on evidence of any breach of trust or partiality in the exercise of it towards persons of a different political character. He is not conscious of bemg culpable in these respects, but is happy in the reflection, that from the time of Ms first appointment in the year 1775, he has discharged the duties of the office with a due regard to all concerned, and with that care and attention, wMch they had a right to ex pect." When Mr. Freeman received Ms notice to remove, he addressed a cutting letter to Mr. Granger, — a copy of wMch is m our possession — in wMch he desires to know the reasons of Ms removal. Said he, " I should have been glad if you had informed me what it was that influenced you in your determination to remove me. Was it grounded on the idea that, however faith ful your deputies are, who were appointed before you came into office, it was necessary their places should be enjoyed by men of your own sect ? — and that be cause they do not resign or die fast enough, vacancies ought to be created for the purpose ?
