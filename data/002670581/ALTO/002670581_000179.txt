LONDON CLAY. 127 This pebble band contains a few organic remains, of which the most common are the teeth of a species of Lamma [Shark] , and the Ditrupa plana also occurs and traces of several species of shells. It reposes upon a somewhat uneven and worn surface of the underlying stratum, small and unimportant however as this bed here is, it is nevertheless remakable for the extent of its range, the uniformity of its lithological characters and the permanence of its organic remains — conditions of the more value from its position between the two main members of the Eocene series. It forms an excellent base line, and its characters are so well marked that it can be traced without much difficulty from the Isle of Wight to Woodbridge in Suffolk, a distance in a straight line of about 160 miles from south-west to north-east." " The basement bed of the London Clay constitutes a well-marked horizon dividing the London Clay forma tion, by a change, both in the palæontological conditions, in the ancient physical geography of the district, and from the older Eocene deposits, which intervene between the Chalk and the London Clay, its mineral mass being composed of the debris of the former, while its animal remains belong to the period of the latter."* The more common fossils of the London Clay here are : — Nucula amygdaloides Pholadomya margaritacea Natica glaucinoides Turritella imbricataria Turtle (bones) Ditrupa plana Zanthopsis tuberculata, Koenig Pinna affinis Ostrea sp.
