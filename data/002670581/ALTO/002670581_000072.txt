48 the lower greensand. Fifteenth Division. Upper Clays and Sand Rock (n8feet). This division consists of forty feet of dark grey clays, with pyrites, separated by eighteen feet of white and fawn coloured sand, from a mass of clays and sands. The sand rises from the base of the cliff, about two hundred yards west of Rocken End, near which, it is said, material has been worked for glass house purposes. Sixteenth Division. Various Sands and Clays (ii 8 feet 4 inches). These constitute the remainder of the section, about half way up, in which is a bed of hard white sand, probably the same bed as that which appears at the base of the cliff on the shore at Rocken End. It there consists of eight or ten feet of hard white sand, with carbonaceous and ferruginous lines, and harder, irregular, ferruginous concretionary masses or bodies. This bed is at the top of the sandy deposits, and must constitute nearly the uppermost bed of the purely sandy deposits ; it is also nearly the uppermost bed of the Lower Greensand formation. It appears in the face of the cliff, rising at an angle of from 2^° to 3°, nearly as far as the top of Blackgang Chine, with blue clayey beds above. Ferruginous sands are the highest beds seen in the road, from South View House to the shore.
