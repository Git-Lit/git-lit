220 ADDENDUM. " The prim√¶val river is not represented by any existing stream. Its course can only be guessed at as having probably been eastward ; its extent is unknown ; its borders, its lakes, and where it met the sea of the period are not yet mapped. Its many streams made flood-banks and deltas, and some portion of its great estuary lay here, in what is now the south-east of England, where land and sea held very different out lines and relative levels from what at present exists."* In earlier times this river had brought down and deposited great quantities of sand, probably when it had a more rapid current and could carry along heavier detritus. Even along with these sands much clay was deposited, and it is in these earlier times that we first find traces ofthe gigantic Dinosauria (frightful lizards), so characteristic of the formation. It is not improbable that the freshwater limestones and clays of the Purbeck series are still earlier vestiges of the river and its work. To speculate on the old land drained by the many streams, which finally joined in one, is no easy matter, but from the nature of the vegetation we may infer that sands and clays predominated. It is certain that some felspathic and micaceous rocks also existed, for we find traces of them in the various deposits of the Wealden area. From the vegetation, we gather that the old land enjoyed a higher temperature than any part of modern Europe, and the immense Dinosauria could not have existed except under the exceptional and warm con ditions prevailing. Coniferous trees flourished in great abundance ; cycads and tree-ferns luxuriated in the lower levels; in the deltaic plain and bordering the * Dixon, " Geology of Sussex," 2nd Edit., 1878, p. 133.
