THIRD DIVISION. 77 bed (by which Dr. Mantell proposed to name the whole of the deposits) ; which is after all but a very subordinate member of the group, consisting merely of a bed of hard laminated sandstone, from 8in. to gin. thick ; and a layer of Rag gin. thick, succeeded by an upper bed of the same lithological character, the whole averaging about two feet in thickness. This bed was locally called " Firestone " by the old inhabitants of the Undercliff, and used as a substitute for bricks for fire* places and the bottoms of ovens. The following fossils are found in this division : — Ammonites rostratus ,, splendens (?) Nautilus radiatus Hopoloparia Saxbyi Vermicularia Pecten sp. Ammonites rostratus ,, psendo-elegans Pecten orbicularis „ varians Trigonia sp. Cardiaster (?) „ elongatus Cucullæa Gyrodus Clathraria Lyelli Bulbs and stems of large spongoid bodies Siphonia Websteri Pecten orbicularis Panopæa sp. Ammonites rostratus inflatus sp. Panopæa plicata Serpula antiquata Siphonia Websteri Exogyra Third Division (Chert Beds). This division consists of from twenty to twenty-four beds of chert and laminated siliceous sandstone alter nating with each other and very unevenly bedded throughout, some of the beds varying in thickness from a few inches to two feet, the seams of the sand stone being interstratified with large concretions of Rag, in the Same line of bedding. The layers of the sandstone vary much in thickness.
