the chalk marl. 99 These beds also occur around the base of the Downs, and in the fields adjoining. The fossils of these zones are generally well preserved as sharp casts. The Turrelites here become rare, and disappear as we go higher. The before-named fossils occur in a disused chalk pit on the upper part of Ventnor Shute, to the right of the high road leading from Ventnor to Newport. Near this place the lower beds of Grey Chalk are exposed in a cutting on each side of the road, in which occurs Holaster complanatus, associated with an Ammonite having prominent ribs, which appears to be a variety of Ammonites Rhotomagensis, some of which are of large size. The Town Cemetery is on the Grey Chalk, but in the excavations few fossils are found beyond Ammonites varians, Pecten Beaverii, etc. A portion of the head and jaws of a large fish was dug up here some time back, having lancet-shaped teeth. The specimen was much crushed, and very friable, and unfortunately was not preserved. Two large pits occur near here, excavated for material for lime burning. They contain few fossils, abounding with iron pyrites of various shapes and forms. The Chalk Marl is exposed in situ in a pit near the upper part of Shanklin Cowleaze, and also on both sides of the lane leading up to it on the left of the road from Ventnor to Shanklin. The Chalk Marl at the pit contains Baculites, Hamites, Scaphites, and Ammonites. Below, in the lane where the strata have been cut through to form the road, Ammonites Mantelli, A. varians, and other marl fossils can be collected ; A. falcatus also occurs. There are also two or three small pits on the roadside around the valley of Luccombe, in one of which Turrelites undulatus and
