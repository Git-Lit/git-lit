THE CRACKERS ROCKS. 31 limestone, and are almost unfossiliferous. In some cases groups of small shells are clustered on their outsides, with pieces of fossil wood, much decayed, and pierced with teredo. Captain Ibbetson, during his survey of the Atherfield deposits, discovered a large nodule, belonging to the Upper deposits, containing several large Trigonia Dadalea, lying on the beach, but were found to be so firmly impacted in the rock, that scarcely a single specimen could be extracted, or separated from the surrounding matrix. These fossils are much larger in the Upper than in the Lower zone. In contrast to these, the Lower zone of nodules is highly interesting, on account of the number and variety of the fossils it contains. It differs from the upper tier of boulders, which is easily distinguished by its extreme hardness and blueish colour : whilst the lower is more easily broken, and slightly ferruginous, and, however hard the nodules are when first fallen from the cliff, they cannot resist the frosts of winter, which split them open, thus disclosing their fossil contents. The reason they were called The Crackers — a name given them by the fishermen — is, that both zones of boulders or concretion first make their appearance on the shore, and are, in consequence, exposed to the action of the waves, which often sweep the cliff for days together, and excavate a cavern in the sands and clays beneath, or between the layers of nodules. This is often aided by fissures in the cliff, caused by the upheaval of the strata. In consequence, the waves rush into these caverns, driving before them a volume of air, which produces a loud concussion. In some instances one or more of the nodules form
