Indeed, when I was a boy, a man occupied a cottage and a garden (long since washed away) which I visited. That old man told of the time when in his youth he had played in green fields then existing on the site of the present white buoy (two-tenths of a mile from the shore) which now warns vessels from the Gurnard Ledges. These ledges consist of rocks of the dislocated Bembridge Limestone stratum, which, being harder than the Tertiary Clays formerly lying under and over them, have remained for the waves to complete their disinte gration. The former superincumbent and adjacent clays have been successively carried away by the same, or even with greater speed by the force of an earlier, narrower, and swifter rush of water than can in the present day be seen in progress. Although I can personally testify to the encroachments of the sea at Gurnard, still it is evident that the coast districts between West Cowes and Yarmouth have equally been encroached upon, at one time more rapidly at one spot, and then equally or even more rapidly at another, either pointing to the fact of the great rapidity with which the Solent has widened its breadth. The elephant stratum was deposited during the existence of the human race, for side by side with bones and tusks of elephants, remains of human beings have been discovered in other regions.* Beyond a doubt elephants could not have dwelt within so circumscribed an area â€¢ That early man saw and hunted the mammoth and other extinct animals. is evident from the pictures he has left us, engraved on pieces of bone. One of these, a mammoth, is drawn with masterly skill. It was found in a cave at La Madelaine, France, and a figure of it can be seen in Boyd-Dawkins' " Early Man in Britain," 1880, p. 105, with many others; or in Geikie, "Text Book of Geology," 1882, p. 905,
