67 ATHERFIELD BEDS. Here, perhaps, a little information will not be out of place as to the best means to be pursued for the purpose of examining the Atherfield beds. From Ventnor, via Blackgang, the excursion can be taken by either a private conveyance, or by any of the different coaches. The Geologist can, if he chooses, alight at the Blackgang Hotel and descend to the shore through the Bazaar, at which visitors are ex pected to make a purchase for the privilege of descending the well-kept path down the Chine. But to the Geologist in search of specimens, the route which takes him to Freshwater, returning by Chale, is preferable, when, on alighting at Chale Church, he will turn down the Military Road, until the head of Whale Chine is reached, a little beyond which a footpath leads through a field to the top of the cliff, following which the path will lead him to the Coast Guard Station ; beyond to the left of the flagstaff he can descend over hummicks and hollows to the shore, over the disintegrated clays, shales and sands ; or sometimes there is a rude platform or path, made by the coastguards and fishermen, to enable them to haul up their boats ; pursuing this westward, the Geologist arrives at a spot called Tie Pits, where large masses of the Lower Perna bed are accumulated. He thus may work his way along the shore up to Ladder Chine, ascending which a footpath leads to the Military Road, Chale Church being again reached in the evening, in time to return by coach. The excursion to Atherfield ought to be extended to two or more visits, as, to examine the strata from Blackgang Chine and its neighbourhood thoroughly, as well as the insides of Whale and Walpen Chines,
