88 the upper greensand. fossils here are in situ, and are easily extracted. In the year 1851 several persons were engaged, by a firm of agricultural chemists, on the summit of St. Catherine's Down, in digging and sifting the beds of Fossiliferous and Chloritic Marl ; but either from the difficulty and the expense attending the labour, and the cost of conveyance, or other causes, the scheme was abandoned. In Mr. Nesbit's tables of Phosphoric Acid from St. Catherine's Down, the casts and nodules of the fossils are stated to contain from 40 to 50 per cent, of phos phate of lime. These beds contain numerous large spongoid bodies, together with nodules, resembling coprolites in form, containing from 15 to 28 per cent. of phosphate of lime. These last are very similar in composition to the bodies interspersed in the corres ponding stratum in the neighbourhood of Farnham, of which the following is an analysis, by J. T. Way. Esq. : Insoluble silicous matter ... *... 16*82 Soluble silica ... ... ... ... 12.92 Organic matter ... ... ... ... 2-29 Phosphoric Acid ... ... ... ... 0-78 Carbonic Acid ... ... ... ... 22-44 Lime 34'68 Magnesia ... ... ... ... ... j-oi Oxide of Iron and Alumina 6-29 The late Dr. Martin, no mean chemist, wrote in his work on the climate of the Undercliff: " In consequence of the phosphatic deposits existing in these beds, I cannot call the attention of the agriculturalists of the neighbourhood too strongly to the fact of so rich and valuable a manure lying within their reach, and the fertilizing property of its composition."
