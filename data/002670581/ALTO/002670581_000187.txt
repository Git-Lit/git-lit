MIDDLE BAGSHOT SERIES. 133 sands containing large Cardita planicosta, Turritella im bricataria, Natica, Nummulites l√¶vigatus. etc. "A hard bed of conglomerate, formed by rounded flint-pebbles in a ferruginous cement, constitutes a marked feature in the cliff, and a strongly defined division between this member of the Middle Bagshot series and the overlying Barton Clay. The pebbles are of various sizes, black for the most part, and some times as much as a foot in diameter. This bed is represented in Whitecliff Bay by a stratum six feet in thickness, with small pebbles disseminated through it, and crushed Turritella, etc."* I have found that the best way to collect the fossils from these more sandy beds of Whitecliff Bay, is to leave them on the clay, and pare off the surrounding matrix with a small pocket knife, leaving them on the beach to dry while collecting others. Each specimen should then be carefully rolled up in paper, and placed securely in a wooden box, great care being necessary as most of these fossils are extremely friable, and many of them badly preserved. Some of the Turritella imbricataria and Cardita planicosta are large, and the shells of the latter are very thick. The beds do not seem to be so well developed in Alum Bay as in Whitecliff Bay, being much thinner ; neither do they offer much attraction to collectors, for when I examined them, some years ago, I only succeeded in obtaining a few specimens of Cardita planicosta. Since that time, however, Mr. Joseph Bastianna, an enthusiastic col lector, especially of the Atherfield fossils, has sent me some good fossils from the Bracklesham series of Alum Bay. * Mem. Geol.
