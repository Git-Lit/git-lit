sands of blackgang chine. 47 part, a bed of ferruginous sandstone, five feet thick, making about twenty feet for the thickness of the entire group, which is more or less fossiliferous throughout. Over this ferruginous concretion, at Blackgang, a streamlet flows, forming a cascade. Cycadæ, Zamia (?), and Clathariœ Lyelli axe frequently found in this neighbourhood. Hopoloparia Longimanus (?) are sometimes found on the shore, as well as detached claws ; this fossil is of an inkey blackness and extremely hard, being very difficult to detach from the matrix. These remains are best developed where the sea washes over the ledge. Carbonised plants occur here, with twigs and stems of trees. This bed also yields the following fossils : — Pauopæa plicata ,, Neocomiensis Pholodomya Martini Cardium peregiinosum „ Voltzii Corbis corrugata Cyprina angulata „ rostrata Isocardia Neocomiensis Thetis minor Corbula striatula Mytilns lanceolatus Gervillia anceps ,, solenoides Lingula truncata Avicula pectinata Anomia (?)
