DESCRIPTION OF THE STRATA. 5 strata, may be conveniently examined in succession, as they rise from the shore to form the cliffs." It may be observed that the whole of the Wealden strata of the Isle of Wight is extremely irregular, and that the thick beds of sandstone, which form conspicuous objects in the cliffs, occasionally thin out rapidly, as may be observed in the case of the bed of greenish sandstone seen. It may also be stated that, with the exception of a few thin be4s in the Upper part, such as the limestones, or Sussex marble and septaria, a band of dark clay, containing Potamides, rests on the marine deposits. Few zones can be traced containing organic remains ; they seem to be scattered through the deposits. Most of the fossils, however, are contained in the Upper beds. The shores and cliffs of the Wealden are rather monotonous, on account of the uniformity and repeti tion of the different strata, with little or ho variety of their fossil contents. Numerous indentations occur at the base of the cliffs, caused by the inroads of the sea, some of which contain ripple-marked slabs of limestone, others with sun-cracks on their surface, and, it is stated, footprints of animals.* Although not very attractive in appearance, the Wealden strata form certainly one of the most important series of deposits of the Cretaceous system, on account of the number and great size of the remains of the terres trial reptiles found in them. At Compton Bay and Atherfield Point, numerous slabs of the Freshwater limestone lie in heaps, inter mixed with the disrupted blocks of the Perna beds. * Not confirmed.
