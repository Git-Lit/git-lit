72 THE GAULT. eroded between there and Winstone, rests on the Lower Greensand. The Gault also forms the slopes around Cook's Castle. The houses in the lower part of Bonchurch stand upon the Gault, and the debris of the superincumbent strata, which has fallen from above. Also the houses in the hollow below the Marine Hotel, at Ventnor, are all built upon the lower portion of the Gault. An outcrop of it occurs on the shore at the west end of Mill Bay, and it also occurs in other patches from Shanklin to Blackgang. The vegetable soil of which the terrace of the Undercliff is composed, consists, in most part, ofthe lower portion ofthe Gault at its base ; it is probably owing to the phosphates this contains that the trees, shrubs, and vegetation flourish in such luxurious growth along the line of the Undercliff, thus aiding largely in forming one of the most picturesque spots in England. The Gault, as well as the Upper Greensand, ends at Blackgang, and re-appears at Compton Bay in a highly inclined position, as at Sandown Bay. The following are the most characteristic fossils of the Gault : — Ammonites Dentatus Inoceramus Sulcatus Pecten quinquecostatus Nucula Pectinata (common) Belemnites minimus Natica Gaultiana Hamites rotundus Limæ Paralla Area carinata Inoceramus concentricus A solarium ornatuni
