TERTIARY SERIES. 144 The Osborne section is peculiarly interesting for the link that it affords between the very different aspect of these beds at Cliff End, as compared with those at St. Helens. The strata of these latter rise from below the Scone Point Limestone, near the site of Worsley's Tower, and crop out near the first Chine in Colwell Bay and Cliff End. West of Binstead Point a thin band of comminuted shells occur, containing Cyrena, Limnæa longiscata, Unio, Melania excavata, Melanopsis, Planorbis discus, etc. " At the west corner of Apley Wood a bed of calcareous sandstone, about four feet thick (full in places of casts of Paludina, associated with numerous Unios, Limnæa, Planorbis, and occasional bones of Turtle) appears on the shore beneath the sea wall."* A few years ago, when on a visit to the neighbour hood, I saw a good section of the Osborne beds displayed near the Priory, or Summer House Point. I also visited the shore near St. Helen's old Church — " now, from the inroads of the sea, situated on the shore, and washed by each recurrent tide, and is converted into a sea-mark " — and worked my way along it towards the Priory, examining as I went the loose blocks of Limestone, many of which I found to be full of the casts of Limnæa and Planorbis. Some workmen were engaged in breaking up these blocks, and though I carefully scrutinised the fragments, I could find no fossils sufficiently perfect for the cabinet. One of the workmen, however, informed me that he had once discovered a fossil turtle in the sandstone which caps the low cliff. The Bembridge Limestone passes into * Mem. Geol.
