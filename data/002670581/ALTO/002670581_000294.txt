236 ECONOMICS. Clay has been dug many years ago, and shallow trenches marking the sites of old workings are still visible (Geological Survey, p. 107). At Shide, near Newport, Pottery and tiles are manufactured from the red clays of the Plastic Clay formation. Bricks are made from the London Clay, which immediately overlies it. Bricks are also made from the clays of nearly all the Tertiary strata. At Ninham the loam overlying the flint gravel is con verted into bricks. At the brick pits north of Arreton Down the brick earth is derived from a red mottled loamy clay, containing a few small flints, and much resembling Plastic Clay, except in its paler colour. About twelve feet of the loam rests upon three feet of flint pebble-gravel, which forms the base of the high level gravel there. At Gunville, near Newport, the Barton Clay furnishes the brick earth, and at Ningwood the Bembridge Marls are converted into both brick and tiles. Alum was formerly manufactured in the Island from the clay of Alum Bay, and as early as 1579, at works in Parkhurst Forest (Geological Survey, 1862, p. 107). Bricks are manufactured along the Isle of Wight Railway at Wroxall, Shanklin, and Sandown, from loamy clay. The clay manufactured in the Isle of Wight during the year 1858 is estimated at 6,750,000 bricks and tiles, worth iOSa8r5Iei,InSr|r0,tt^el,GlrlogicalrTSurvey of Great Britain and Ireland, for 1858, by Robert Hunt, F.R.S. , part n., p. 38.
