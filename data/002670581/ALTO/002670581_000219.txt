LATER TERTIARY DATE. 161 occurs at levels as high about that end of the Island as the top of the cliffs at Sandown, where there are three or four feet of it, more than ioo feet above the sea ; and Skinner's Hill, near Newchurch, is capped by what appears to be a fluviatile gravel at least no feet above the sea. These would seem to be deposits of a river now represented by the Eastern Yar, flowing more than a hundred feet above its present level, draining land to the seaward of the present cliffs of Sandown, and emptying itself into the sea, or estuary, at the place indicated by the shingle at the Foreland. The Mammalian Gravel at Fresh water are at a corresponding height to the chalk cliffs flanking the source of the Western Yar at the west end of the Island." In the extensive beds of gravel in the Downs above Ventnor, on the south-west of Wroxall Down, and on both sides of the road leading over the Downs to Wroxall are pits, varying in depth from 6 to 8 feet, and which have been worked for many years. The lower portion of these beds consists chiefly of black and grey flints, embedded in a reddish clay corresponding with the brick-earth of other parts. The higher portion con tains masses, six to eight feet thick, of flints in a more crystallised form than those found in the lower beds ; they are of a greyish colour and much pulverised. The only fossils that I have heard of as being found in these flints are Galerites albo-galerus, Ananchytes ovatus, Micraster cor-anguinum, sponges, such as Choanites and Ventriculites, and several branched species. From here the chalk has been entirely removed, but how the flints have become broken and splintered it is difficult to say. Their appearance would justify the supposition I
