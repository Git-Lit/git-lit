THE HUMAN PERIOD. 204 narrow standing stones so frequently found in Denmark, and there termed " Banta stene," or memorial stones. Many similar also occur at Carnac, in Brittany. Lockhart, an archæologist, makes the following statement, in his " Guide to the Isle of Wight," p. 35: "The 'Longstone' on Mottistone Common is a very large and rough quadrangular mass of stone, bearing upon it no marks of the chisel. Though somewhat rudely formed, it consists of stratified iron sandstone from the Lower Greensand formation, the prevailing stone in that neighbourhood, abundance of which may be had from Compton Bay Cliff. The height of this upright stone is 13 feet, and it is b\ feet wide on its broadest side, and 20 feet in circumference. Its depth is believed to be considerable, and its weight a little over 30 tons. Four feet distant is a recumbent stone 9 feet 3 inches in length, its width at the widest part 4 feet, and its height at the thickest end i\ feet. There is a third stone of a similar kind about 300 yards distance from the Longstone, to the east on the way side. This stone is 4ft. 3m. wide, and 2ft. 2in. thick. Another stone lies near the gate from the Calbourne and Mottistone road on the pathway to the Longstone, from which it is distant 570 yards. Most probably these stones once formed an ancient British cromlech." In the Journal of the British Archæological Associa tion for 1882, Captain J. Thorp describes an ancient British barrow in the Island, and as it is of great interest and importance, I give the extract in full. In the journal may be seen a plate, showing a section of the mound, the urn found in it and a picture of the skeleton, and the skull with the hole referred to. Captain Thorp says :
