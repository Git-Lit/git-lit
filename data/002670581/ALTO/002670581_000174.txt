TERTIARY SERIES 124 allowed certain Geologists to re-group the Tertiaries as follows* : — Eocene, Lower.— Woolwich and Reading Beds (Plastic Clays). London Clay (Bognor Beds). Part of Lower Bagshot Sands. Middle. — Bracklesham Beds. Alum Bay and Bournemouth Leaf Beds. Middle Bagshot, and part of Lower Bagshot Sands. Upper. — Barton Clay, and Upper Bagshot Beds. Oligocene. — Headon Beds. Osborne and St. Helen's Beds. Bembridge Beds. Hempstead Beds. Miocene. — Absent in England. Pliocene. — Not represented in the Isle of Wight. The Lower Eocene Strata of the Isle of Wight. Still continuing our upward course, we find a narrow band of Plastic Clay reposing in the Chalk, and accom panying it across the Island ; it has been worn and eroded by the action of the water, but in a much less degree than the surface of the Chalk. These coloured Plastic Clays extend to Woolwich, Reading, Newhaven * If the render desires to pursue the subject further I should recommend him to study the following papers. In any case they form a most valuable aid in working out the Tertiaries of our Island. Judi>, J. W. On the Oligocene Strata of the Hampshire Basin. Quart. Journ. Geol.
