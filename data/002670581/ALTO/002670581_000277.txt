ADDENDUM. ••>_-"•<.?•-?__ 5>^vSgh INCE the chapters on the Wealden were jQ-Sja^V printed, a friend to whom I am indebted '&==— iy for valuable assistance in the compilation -V--V ,f) '»£~f\£ an<^ revision of the present work, has kindly (*^> sent me the following well written paper as an addendum to the chapter on the Wealden. As it contains ideas and facts bearing upon the subject by men who have carefully studied the phenomena of the formation, and who may be considered reliable authori ties, I have inserted it as an appendix. Having glanced over the Wealden formation as exposed in the Island, I will now give a sketch of the country of the Iguanodon, as Mantell called it, in his " Petrifactions and their Teachings," and the nature of its flora and fauna. The Wealden strata were deposited in the form of a delta by a great river, which, according to Mr. Wood,* probably came from the west,! having its sources on land, long since destroyed, between Ireland and Spain, and its course coincident with the present English Channel. This delta extended, according to the present evidence, from the Isle of Purbeck to Belgium and Germany (Hanover), and traces of it are found in central France. * Phil. Mag., 1863. ser. 4, vol. xxv., pi. 5. t Geikie, in his " Text Book," 1882, p. 817, says, " The river probably des cended from the north-west, draining a vast area, of which the existing mountain groups of Britain are perhaps merely fragments."
