sandown bay. 49 This division ends the description of the Atherfield section of the Lower Greensand deposits and organic remains. According to Dr. Fitton, these deposits contain 1 50 species of shells, the stratagraphical position of which has been accurately determined. From this it appears that 130 species occur in the lowermost 150 feet of strata, and that in the upper beds — comprising a thick ness of nearly 700 feet — but twenty additional species are met, with few, if any, organic remains appearing in the upper layers. Thus, it appears, six-sevenths of them occur in the lowermost 150 feet, or in the first three groups, and throughout the remainder of the distance, from the Crackers to the Gault — the greatest portion of the formation — but eighteen additional are added to the list. Geological writers say but little on the section of Lower Greensand at the east end of Sandown Bay, and, excepting the remarkable position in which the deposits are thrown, owing to the upheaval of the Wealden, there is little of interest. It corresponds as to geological site and high inclination of the strata to that of Compton Bay. It is obscure at the upper part, but affords as good a view of the junction with the Wealden as other places mentioned. The organic remains in the upper beds of the deposits are all destroyed, chiefly by the infiltration of iron, and those that are recognisable are in such a decomposed state as to be untransportable — the Lower, or Perna beds, however, being excepted. Dr. Fitton has given a section representing between four and five miles, in which Shanklin Down forms the western, and Bembridge Down the eastern limit. On the eastern side of the Bay the flinty chalk has a total thick- D
