42 THE LOWER GREENSAND. of the strata and its fossil contents. Red ferruginous nodules line the shore, and are continued into the interior of the Chines. Many of the fossils are con verted into pyritic masses, which give them a glittering and bronzed appearance. These beds are subdivided by Dr. Fitton into two parts, the upper consisting of a brown fossiliferous clay about 33 feet thick, and the lower of a dark greenish mud, sand, and clay, about 24 feet. The bed extends from the shore below Walpen Chine to Brown's Down. In the Lower zone are : — Gryphæa sinuata Cones, probably of the pine tribe, with stems and Panopæa elongata „ mandibula Carbonised vegetable im- pressions (probably ferns and grasses) twigs, also wood bored by teredo And in the Upper : — Panopæa mandibula ,, plicata Tellina inæqualis Venus vectensis (Parva) Scaphites gigas (Ancy-- locerus) Nucula ? Isocardia Neocomiensis (qu. ornata) Corbula striatula Lima semisulcata Gryphæa sinuata Pinna Robinaldina Ammonites Deshayesii (very large) Ammonites Martini Eighth Division. Upper Crioceras Group (46 feet 2 inches). This group is seen for some distance along the shore, east of Walpen Chine, which is crossed by it, as are also Ladder and Whale Chines. It consists of sandy nodules, embedded in sand, and containing Crioceras, Bowerbanhii, Ammonites Martini, Gervillia sole-
