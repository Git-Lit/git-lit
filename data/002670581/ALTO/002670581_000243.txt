185 EAST END. The slip on the east, at East End, occurred at the end of the last century, and that under St. Catherine's, below Gore Cliff, at the beginning of the present. Canon Venables writes, regarding the landslip at East End, "The romantic wildness of this tract is due to a series of landslips, of which the earliest formed a part of the great convulsion by which the whole range of cliffs from Luccombe to Blackgang was laid bare." When Sir Henry Englefield visited East End, about the year 1800, he remarked: "Although deep cracks and evidences of continual subsidence intersect every part, yet the rocky cliff more to the northward seems to have attained perfect stability, and the luxurious coppice must have long grown undisturbed." The two latest slips of any extent took place from 1810 to 1818, carrying away 30 and 50 acres of land respectively. Mr. Webster visited the spot in 181 1, just after the occurrence of the first slip, and thus describes it in a letter to Sir Henry Englefield : " I was surprised at the scene of devastation, which seems to have been occasioned by some recent convulsion of nature. A considerable portion of the cliff had fallen down, strewing the whole ground between it and the sea with its ruins ; huge masses of solid rock started up amidst smaller fragments, whilst immense quantities of loose marl, mixed with stones, and even the s^il above with the wheat still growing on it filled up the spaces between and formed heaps of rubbish which are scarcely accessible. Nothing had resisted the force of the falling rocks. Trees were ievelled with the ground, and many lay half buried in the ruins. The streams were choked up, and pools of water were formed in many
