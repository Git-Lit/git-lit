THE CRACKERS ROCKS. 33 in his " Monograph of the Crustacea."" But of late years these fossils appear to have thinned out, and to have become exceedingly sparse, and those which are found seem to have undergone a different chemical change, and to have become transformed into pyrites. They are called by the fishermen " fossil Prawns." The best time to search for them is when the clays are laid bare by the wash of the sea on the strand, or in the cliffs, after rains. The Upper portion of these deposits yields a much larger variety of evidently the same species, named Meyeria Vectensis. These are found sparse in the upper beds, and are generally enclosed either in slabs of hardened clay, or mostly in oblong nodules of septaria. This bed contains small Lobster remains, also in the same state of preservation. The first subdivision (i) is composed of brown sand and clay. Many of the fossils here are found in groups, and without matrix ; also on slabs, exposed in relief. The following is a miscellaneous list of the most characteristic : — Pholadomya Martini Corbula stria tula Nucula simplex „ spathnlata „ scapha Mytilus æqualis Pinna Robinaldina Venus Vectensis Avicula lanoeolata Gervillia linguloides Gryphæa liarpa Pecten orbicularis Lima Anomia lævigata „ convexa Ammonites Dushayesii ,, Cornuelian us ,, Hambro\'ii Astacus Vecteusis The concretions in this bed also contain the fol lowing : — * " Palæontographical Society " for 1862.
