ORGANIC REMAINS 7 gritty sandstone, situated near the top of the cliff, will be found the large mussel of the period, the Unio Valdensis ; they are also to be found on the shore, but often water-worn, and sometimes thickly incorporated with the matrix. Many of the bones are water-worn, through having been exposed to the abrading action of the currents of the great river, before becoming deposited in its bed ; this result is due also to the wash of the sea. They are thereby rendered valueless for teaching purposes. The bones, when found in situ, are generally abraded, having been transported from probably long distances in the bed of the river, of which the Wealden is the delta. Those found in the clays are commonly less injured, and are preserved by the plastic material with which they are enveloped. The bones are chiefly of a jet black, and strongly impregnated with iron, especially those in Brook Bay, which are permeated with pyrites. Groups of brilliant crystals of this mineral often invest the outer surface. The late Dr. Wilkins, of Newport, purchased in 1854, a wagon load of bones, of gigantic size, for the museum at Newport, most of them being dug from the strand. For a fuller description of these and others the reader is referred to page 9 of this chapter. Journeying along the shore from Blackgang, beneath the cliffs of the Lower Greensand deposits, until the Point at Atherfield is reached, westward of which a remarkable change in the earth's history is revealed ; and from the series of marine strata just passed, we are at once introduced to a series of deposits consisting of clays, lime, and sandstones of fluviatile, or river origin. The red and yellow cliffs which com-
