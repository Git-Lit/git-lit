OUTLIERS. 179 present ; whilst the almost universal confluence of the minor valleys, and their final terminations in some main trunk conducting to the sea, proclaim to have been due to atmospheric waters. Those excavates in the chalk beds have a less pronounced incline and a greater regularity, which is accounted for by the uniform texture of the chalk itself. The chief of these valleys is that which extends from Brixton to Sandown, cutting off the southern chalk hills from the range which extends across the centre of the Island. Conjecture must take the place of knowledge as to what has become of the immense mass of missing strata, consisting of the Lower Greensand, Gault, Upper Greensand, and the whole of the chalk deposit, which probably averaged some miles in width, and upwards of a thousand feet in thickness. It has dis appeared by the combined forces of upheaval and denudation, leaving the surface of the Island in its present form. The same causes have produced many instances of isolated masses, or " outliers," as they are called, of which the most important occur in the neighbourhood of Godshill. They exhibit the same stratification, and are completely detached from the strata of which they once formed a e&3trattÂ©iis portion. Between Godshill and Sheepwash Farm stands a large, isolated, turf covered mound, rounded and weather-worn ; it is from 50 to 60 feet high, and its detached position is entirely due to the action of rain and rivers. Godshill Church stands upon an elevation consisting of Lower Greensand, and forms a prominent figure in the landscape ; it can be seen from a distance of
