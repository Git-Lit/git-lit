BROOK POINT. 3 trees resemble the rafts that are annually brought down from the interior of the country by the great rivers of North America, which are drifted out of their course, become water-logged, and sink into the bed of the river." The strata in the neighbourhood of Brook Point consist of hard pale sandstone ; blocks of which be come disintegrated and lie scattered on the shore. But the fish palates and scales are usually found on the strand on a level with the Pine Raft, probably washed out of the more loose sand deposits which occur in the cliff. The upheaval which has elevated the Wealden beds traverses the Island nearly east and west, and is hidden beneath the superincumbent strata to the east of Atherfield Point as far as Sandown Bay, where they again come to the sur face, a short distance from where the Old Fort formerly stood — where Dr. Mantell has placed the axis of upheaval — forming with its low cliffs the sea face of the parish of Yaverland. The lowest beds at Brook Point, at the base of the cliff, are a white or pale grey sandstone, with fucoidal markings, containing iron pyrites, being almost un fossiliferous ; detached bones of reptiles are some times found in it. The beds are described as very irregular at the Point, where they have been subjected to great pressure, but they change their mineral character at short distances. The sandy beds become calcareous, and similar to the irregular beds of waving sandstone which rest on them. Above the sandstone is a bed of hard red marl, which, although it dis appears at the Point, makes its appearance again on the shore fifteen or twenty feet further eastward. Near
