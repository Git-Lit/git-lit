112 CHALK FORMATION. Brading Down the strata is vertical, as shown by the line of flints. In one of these pits masses of Inocerami in a commi nuted state are found ; but the pits, generally speaking, are so nearly destitute of fossils as to make examination scarcely of interest, except it be to study the position of the beds. The only places where the Upper Chalk fossils can be collected in situ, is from the lower beds at Culver Cliff, and at Freshwater. At the latter place they can be reached by rowing round the base of the cliffs. Of the east end of the chalk range, which terminates in Culver Cliffs, Sir Henry Englefield writes: "The Chalk rises directly out of the sea, nearly perpendicular, to a great height, and being totally in shadow to the blue sky above, and the pellucid green of the sea at its foot, it has a sort of aærial tint."* At White Cliff Bay the Upper White Chalk ceases with the Belemitella Mucronata zone, which occupies a position in the north-west end of the Bay, immediately below the plastic clay of the adjoining Tertiary strata. This zone, in respect to its junction with the plastic clay, takes the same position at Alum Bay, and the characteristic fossil is to be found at both places, either in the fallen blocks on the shore, or at the former place, by ascending the talus at the foot of the cliff. Referring to the fossils of the cretaceous formation, Professor A. Geikie writes : " Foraminifera now reached an importance as rock-builders which they had never before attained. Their remains are abundant in the White Chalk of the Northern European Basin, and • " Picturesque Account of the Island." 1816, p. 78.
