APPENDIX. 213 Valley,"* and I cannot do better than quote the passage at length. Professor Jones writes : — " We see that in the Hampshire area the much denuded Tertiary beds and their gravel cappings form a half lozenge, having its blunt apex between Salisbury and Winchester, and reaching beyond Chichester on the east, and nearly to Dorchester on the west, with the Channel and the Solent on the south. And this is recognizable as the main portion of a broad spoon shaped trough (syncline, or rather centrocline), that was flanked by the out-coming chalk of Dorset, Wilts, and Hants on its north, and had for its southern border the upturned Chalk strata of a southern anticlinal fold, now mostly destroyed by the sea. This border was continuous with the chalk around Dorchester; and, passing as an unbroken ridge through what is now Purbeck and the Isle of Wight, it stretched eastward to join the Chalk of Sussex, and extended south and east as part of the great Chalk area of north-western France. "This somewhat lozenge-shaped area of soft Tertiaries and gravelsf had a symmetrical river-system, draining inwards from the harder and higher chalk margin (as readily seen on any map of Dorset, Hants, and the Isle of Wight) ; and a large central river ran from west to east, opening out, at an early date, below Selsea. Subsequently the wall of chalk and otb^r upturned strata, between Swanage and the IsL Wight, was breached by the sea outside and the streams within ; and Handfast Point, with "Old Harrj • Trans.
