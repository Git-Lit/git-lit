GENERAL DESCRIPTION. 71 or forty feet are totally devoid of organic remains, with the exception of a few phosphatic concretions, which range throughout, and some spiral shaped masses, exhibiting concentric rings, said to be Coprolites (?). A small portion of the Gault occurs on the east side of the Gas House, in situ on the shore at Ventnor, also further east, in Horse Shoe Bay, near Bonchurch, and extends from thence on the top of the cliff to Shanklin. A good section of the Gault is seen in Sandown Bay, in its place between the Upper and Lower Greensand, following the upheaval of the strata, where it can be measured approximately at the base of the talus it has formed. The Meadow called the Cowleaze, above Shanklin, is composed of the Gault. All along the terrace of the Undercliff may be seen masses of the debris of the superincumbent strata, consisting of huge masses of Chalk and Upper Greensand, some of which have sunk bodily into the soil, whilst others may be seen scattered in a variety of positions. These, in their descent, have scooped up the earth's surface, causing it to be very uneven. On almost all the terraces the Gault has been shorn of many feet of its thickness, the upper portion being thrust before it, by the falling strata, into the sea. This portion of the subject will be referred to in the description of the various Landslips which have occured in the Undercliff, caused by a solid mass of strata resting upon a bed of saponaceous clay, i.e., the Gault. The upper part of the site on which the village of Wroxall stands is composed of Gault. The lower portion, which shows evidences of having been much
