54 THE LOWER GREENSAND. A great depression of the Lower Greensand begins at Bonchurch, and extends to near Rocken End, where, as between Bonchurch and Ventnor, it dis appears entirely, and is apparently hidden beneath the shore. Some idea of the extent of the depression may be gleaned from the fact that west of Luccombe the junction bed occupies a position probably from ioo to 150 feet above the shore, and is found level with the shore near the east side of the Gas House at Ventnor. This depression takes place in less than two miles. It can be traced at the west end of Mill Bay, below Ventnor ; from this spot it again disappears, until Binnel Bay is reached, where it again crops out on the shore between the latter place and Puckaster Cove ; here it again takes a slight rise, and appears in a low cliff on the east side of the slope, up which the fishermen wind their boats. Small patches of it appears above Watershute Bay, near the lighthouse. Following from thence the cliff path, we reach the foot of the landslip below (Gore Cliff), and the wild ruin brought about by that catastrophe bursts at at once into view. Chale Bay is next reached, a few yards west of which the white sands appear which form the supposed upper deposits of the Atherfield section, and from here the elevation of strata begins. The junction bed between the Gault and Lower Greensand is described as a" solid and hard mass at Folkestone, about eighteen inches thick, jutting out beyond the clay above and the sand beneath, glittering with metallic pyrites, and seamed with glassy crystals and selenite. There is that curious conglomerate of rounded potato-like lumps of phosphate of lime, and scraggy gnarled boughs of trees. The gnarly boughs
