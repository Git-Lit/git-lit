116 CHALK FORMATION. In 1875, M. Barrois, the eminent French Geologist, published in " Les Annales des Sciences Geologiques," a paper on " La Craie de l'lle de Wight." As it is chiefly to him, and to Mr. Whittaker, we owe the systematic description of the Chalk ' Deposits in England, I give the following table, -which I have drawn up from his paper. The arrangement of the zones in the Chalk of the central ridge is as follows, commencing from below : — Cldoritic Marl.— 6ft. 6in. Hard Chalk. — Slightly glauconitic, 5 feet. Only sponges found. 5 Slightly Sandy Chalk.— 16ft. 3in. Mottled white and blue grey. The most common fossils M - are Tarrelites and Scaphites. g Blue-Grey Chalk.— 97ft. 6in. Hard, and with a O conehoidal fracture. Occurs in regular beds of from 1st 8in. to 3ft. 3in., separated from \ other by a few inches of clay. Fossils rare. Itwceramut lubiatuf, Schenb. zone. — 130ft. Hard, dry Chalk, dug for lime (list of 10 fossils œ given). g S Terebratellu sjlacilin, d'Orb. zone. — 65ft. Contains the Chalk-Rock of Whitaker. Regular beds -, of hard, compact Chalk, about 20 inches 2 J thick, separated from each other by a few P inches of clay (13 fossils quoted). Near the top of this zone is a bed of green coated nodules 2 (Chalk-Rock) about 4 inches thick ; above this a is the same white chalk without flints, but less marly than the beds below, and this contains the characteristic fossils in great abundance. It varies from 6 to 9 feet in thickness. Black Plastic Clay. — Like Gault-Clay, and varying from 1 to 4 inches in thickness.
