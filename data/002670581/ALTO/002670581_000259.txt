THE HUMAN PERIOD. 201 to belong to the Roman-British period, about a.d. 300, was found with the remains." Dr. Martin also mentions a huge antler, which from its size must once have graced the head of a red deer. A skull of the same animal was found in a quarry at Bonchurch ; and a bed i8in. in thickness, composed of cockle shells, was discovered in the crevice of a large rock. As no cockles could have been obtained nearer than Brading Haven (now enclosed from the sea), this doubtless once formed a refuse heap. The following discovery is a sequel to Dr. Martins : Some workmen digging within a distance of fifty yards, and in a direct line above the spot he mentions, found underneath a large rock they were removing the entire skeleton of a man. It was in a sitting posture, with the skull and spinal column fractured, and both legs broken. The man had evidently been crushed to death by the rock which also formed his monument. Again, about 20 yards in a line with the place indicated by Dr. Martin, the skeletons of a cow and calf were dis covered ; both were much crushed and broken. It is possible that both human and animal life had been destroyed by a sudden fall of strata, similar to that which often occurs along the Undercliff. The number of flint implements recorded as being found in the Island is small. Lockhart, in his guide, published in 1870, gives it as five. Since that date several more have been discovered in Gurnard Bay, near Cowes ; also on the shore at Ventnor a flint was found cut into a most curious shape. It was presented by the late Dr. Martin to the Ryde Museum, and is thus described by the late Mr. H. Westropp : â€” " The implement is of a tribranchial form, each arm of nearly
