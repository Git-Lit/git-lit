chloritic and fossiliferous marl. 87 numerous, and the same ma}- be said of it between Ventnor and Niton, where large blocks are met with all along the shore, until Rockenend is reached. This is the best route for collecting fossils, both from this stratum and the Upper Greensand. Much debris of the latter, in the shape of blocks of all sizes, is met with, the fossils being weathered out. The Fossiliferous and Chloritic Marl are exposed in situ in a quarry near the Ventnor Railway Station, resting on the Upper Greensand. They are also met with at the Railway Station itself, which was formerly a disused quarry, from whence much of the material for building purposes was excavated during the rise of the town. It has since been much enlarged and ex tended for the purpose of forming the Station. It is only when the quarrymen are at work removing the top beds that fossils can be procured. The quarry near exhibits a good section for the purpose of measure ment, but it is not worked at present. Going westward, St. Lawrence Shute (formed by a depression of the strata) has caused the upper beds both of the Chloritic and Fossiliferous Marl to appear, a little distance up the road, resting on the Chert Beds. Many fossils have been collected here. The next place is Gore Cliff, before mentioned, on the sea face of St. Catherine's Down, where the above two beds can be examined. As they only crop out near the edge of the cliff, which is here elevate to probably 150 feet, it renders their examination a some what dangerous feat to a timid person. In spite of this drawback, however, it is well worth a visit, as the constant exposure of the surface of the strata to the elements has caused it to become soft and shaly. The
