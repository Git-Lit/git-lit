" WHITE CHALK. 113 some of the hard limestones of the Southern Basin are mainly composed of their aggregated shells. Some of the more frequent genera are Globigerina, Orbitolina, Porosphæra, Nodosaria, Texhdaria, and Rosalia." * In " Science Gossip," some vears ago, a paper appeared, communicated by Mr. Angell, of Winchester, who makes the following remarks : — " Having made an excellent collection [of Foraminifera] from some chalk taken from the cavity of a flint, I wish to bring it before the notice of your readers. All things relating to the formation of the Chalk are now of special interest, in consequence of the identity of forms, recently dis covered in the deep Atlantic dredgings, with those of the fossil animalculæ of the Chalk deposits. In my collection the shells are beautifully perfect, in conse quence of their being enclosed in a flint cavity ; but the fact of their having been found in that position only proves that the flint enveloped the sponge, which was surrounded by myriads of like forms, and that the nucleus of the flint afterwards became silicated, together with the animalculæ, which having been preserved from pressure, the forms now present them selves as beautiful and perfect as at their death." A few words as to the collection of these minute fossils may not be out of place here. If we select a round flint we shall find in many cases its interior to be filled with a white powder. This powder must be tied up in a piece of linen and shaken about in water until the water that runs from it is perfectly clear. The bag should then be opened, and the contents dried without heat, and on a careful examination being made it will * Geikie, "Text Book of Geology," 1882, p. 804. H
