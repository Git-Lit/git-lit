18 WEALDEN FORMATION, the fractured portions remain near each other ; the vertebræ are more or less displaced, yet they maintain relation to the positions they originally occupied ; the bones of the fore-legs have been torn from their sockets and this must have taken place before the specimen was imbedded in the mud and sand, for the glenoid cavities were filled with stone : these facts prove that the carcass of the original must have undergone muti lation before the bones were reduced to a skeleton ; and that the dislocated and broken parts were held together by the muscles and integuments ; in this state the trunk was borne down the stream, and at length sank into the mud of the delta, and formed a nucleus around which the stems and leaves of cycadeous plants and ferns were accumulated, and river shells became inter mingled in the general mass. " The phenomena here contemplated cannot, I con ceive, be satisfactorily explained upon any other supposition than that which implies a long transport, by the agency of streams and currents : the carcasses of the colossal reptiles must have been exposed to such an action for a considerable time, and the source of the mighty river which flowed through the Country of the Iguanodon, must, therefore, like that of the Mississippi have been far distant from the delta which in the course of innumerable ages accumulated at its mouth."* • From MantelTs " Wonders of Geology."
