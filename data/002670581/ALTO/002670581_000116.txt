82 THE UPPER GREENSAND. Appuldurcombe, from whence the prospect is very extensive and varied, commanding, as it does, views of the Church of Godshill, on the top of its low rounded hill ; Arreton, sleeping in the shadow of the Down ; Newchurch, with its white spire ; the valley of the Yar ; the Apse and Bordwood woodland ; the snowy Culver Cliffs, and the Downs bounding the scene. Outcrops of the strata occur at Rew Farm, where they can be seen picturesquely exposed in a field, near to which a hedge bank is white in Springtime with a profusion of snowdrops. The Upper Greensand forms the base of the knoll in Appuldurcombe Park, on which stands the lower portion of an obelisk, composed of Cornish granite, erected in 1774 by Sir Richard Worsley, the founder of the estate, in memory of his kinsman, Sir Robert. It was originally 70 feet high, but was struck by lightning in 1831, which shivered it in two, and the ruins of the upper portion lie around its base. The Upper Greensand also extends around the west side of the Park, and crops out at the village of Nettlecombe, on the opposite side of the valley. It extends round the base of St. Catherine's Down, beginning at The Hermitage, a mansion built on a ridge, or spur, formed by the termination of St. Catherine's Down ; it also extends round the Down to Blackgang. Above the house stands a column, called the "Alexandrian Pillar," of the Roman Doric order; it is 72 feet high, sur mounted by a ball, and forms a conspicuous object in the landscape, as it can be seen nearly all over the Island, together with the two towers on St. Catherine's Down, a little south of it. It is constructed out of the 4 feet seam of sandstone of the Upper Greensand. On
