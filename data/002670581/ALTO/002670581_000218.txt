160 TERTIARY SERIES Mr. Thomas Codrington, in writing to a gentleman on this subject a few years ago, and whose letter was then placed at my disposal, writes : â€” "The Foreland Gravel is mentioned in Forbes' Memoir and the Memoirs of the Geological Survey as being ' a deposit extending from the Chalk to Foreland Point.' But there are two deposits of very different character. The true Foreland Gravel on the sea level at Foreland Point ends rather abruptly about half-a mile to the S.W. It contains a very large portion of beach shingle, distinctly stratified in layers of assorted sizes, with a dip towards Foreland Point. There are bands of clear sharp sand, a layer of rounded pebbles as big as oranges being immediately overlaid by clean sand. There are pebble bands in which pebbles are stained with iron, ending sharply above, and covered with white pebbles ; the upper part is more clayey, may have been derived from the cap of overlying drift. The lower part of the gravel is entirely free from clay. The structure and material of the shingle bank stretch ing across the mouth of Brading Harbour, as laid open in the gravel pits near the ferry, are precisely similar to the Foreland Gravel ; they are, I believe, deposits of shingle and blown sand formed at the mouth of the river (?) Overlying the gravel is a drift of a matrix of sandy clay, with unrolled flints and tertiary pebbles, and it is this which extends over the edges of the Tertiary beds nearly to the chalk of Bembridge Down, and from this the flint implement came. Towards Bembridge Down, where the drift reaches as high as 1 20 feet above the sea level, it consists of a bed of flints and Tertiary pebbles, covered up by five or six feet of sandy clay. A drift of similar character commonly
