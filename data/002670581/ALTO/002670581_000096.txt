70 THE GAULT. of this kind, when the two different surfaces which had thus slid presented the appearance, long after it had taken place, of being highly polished, and the separation was as perfect as though made with a cutting instrument. The Gault of the Island may be described generally as a blue clay, more or less sandy, with minute spangles of mica distributed through it. It contains little or no calcareous matter, but Gypsum, in the form of crystals of selenite, is sometimes present in small quantities. The fossils are few, and scattered at rare intervals, but they are peculiar of the species found in the Lower Greensand, having extended upward. The total thick ness of the Gault in Compton Bay, as measured in the cliff, was found to be ioo feet. Here, after a fall of the cliff, a few fossils can be collected, chiefly from the lower portion, where most of the characteristic fossils occur. Inoceramus, Sulcatus, Natica, Gaultina, and Ammonites Dentatus are amongst the most prominent. The latter occurs as a hard, brittle, coal black, polished substance, the inner whorls being permeated and held together by a hard phosphatic concretion, and, like all the fossils of the Island Gault, occur in a state of cast, the shell having totally disappeared, leaving nothing but the cast of the interior. In the Ammonites, the extreme inner whorl is often transformed into pyrites, with the exception of Ammonites Dentatus, and a round backed, smooth variety. Nothing but the impressions of the other fossils incidental to the Gault are found ; they can, however, be easily identified, when compared with those from the Gault at other places. They occur from ten to fifteen feet from the Junction Bed of the Lower Greensand, before described. The upper thirty
