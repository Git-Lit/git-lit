8 WEALDEN FORMATION, prise the strata stretch away westward to Compton Bay, a distance of six or eight miles, and end in the lofty promontory of Freshwater white cliffs. Near Atherfield Point the organic remains are those of animals which inhabited brackish water, conse quently their presence points to deposits as being those of an estuary or mouth of a river ; which, at some remote period, discharged itself into the sea, as both marine and fluviatile shells can be collected within a short distance of each others habitat : here, also, the two divisions of strata unite. After a storm or ground swell the shore in the vicinity is strewn with the debris of the Wealden, and the lower portion of the Lower Greensand deposits (Perna beds) ; that of the Wealden consisting of thin shales, dark clays, and sep taria, with slabs having potamides and cyclas on their surfaces, etc., exhibiting a disordered mass of ruins, as though some giant hand had strewn the strata and its remains broadcast. Thin slabs of pyrites lie about in all directions, on the surfaces of which are often found the petrified remains of the spines and scales of the Hybodus, a river shark or pike ; the spines are said to have formed the anterior part of the dorsal fin. Other slabs contain what appears to be the comminuted wing cases of insects ; also teeth and vertebr√¶ of small fish. With reference to the fossilised remains of the gigantic animals, which have left their disjointed remains in this ancient delta, it must be borne in mind that they are mostly separated by the wash of the waters from the great river and its tributaries. The skeletons, after being long exposed to the current, were disjointed ; the sinews and muscles became macerated ; the bones which composed the skeleton became separated ; and
