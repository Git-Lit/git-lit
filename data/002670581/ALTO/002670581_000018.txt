4 WEALDEN FORMATION, the Point the beds arch over and incline opposite ways ; in one case in a direction slightly varying from due north, so as to bring them beneath the Lower Green sand in Compton Bay, where they disappear ; and in the other in an easterly direction towards Atherfield Point, where they also disappear beneath the same strata. Thus it will be seen that, both at the west and the east, the Wealden strata are terminated at their junc tion with the Lower Greensand. From thence they are prolonged beneath the sea to the Isle of Purbeck, and in an easterly direction beneath Atherfield Point. Having briefly described the strata at Brook Point, and the Pine Raft, it will not be necessary to give more than a brief outline of the deposits which con stitute the Wealden formation, owing to the sameness of them throughout, and, although interesting from a scientific point of view, would be of little interest to the general reader. I have, however, given an appended description of the lithological composition of the beds, together with a list of the fossils, at the end of the chapter. The whole is divided into two groups, â€” the Upper and the Lower. The Upper will be found at Atherfield Point, and the Lower at Brook Point. The Upper consists of dark shaly clay, splitting on exposure to the weather into what is termed paper shales, together with seams of sand and thin layers of shelly limestone ; and the Lower of sandstone, and red, green, and variegated marls. " Westward of Brook Point, and for a considerable distance beyond Compton Grange Chine, the red marls and sandstones, which form the base of the Wealden
