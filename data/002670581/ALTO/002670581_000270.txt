212 APPENDIX. in the Chalk between Eastbourne and Culver Cliff, emptied itself into some larger river flowing in a westerly direction. In 1862, the Rev. W. Fox, of Brixton, Isle of Wight a well-known name throughout the Island, wrote as follows : — * " This chain of land [Dorset to the Needles] might, or might not, be so cleft in twain as to allow the rivers of Dorset and Wilts to find a passage through them to the main ocean. My opinion, however, is that they had no such outlet : but that, at that far distant period, the entire drainage of more than two counties — em bracing the rivers that join the sea at Poole and Christchurch — flowed through what is now called Christchurch Bay, down the Solent, and joined the sea at Spithead. According to this theory the Solent was at ' that time an estuary somewhat like the Southampton Water, having but one opening to the British Channel ; but of so much more importance than the latter as it was fed by a vastly greater flow of fresh water ; and it further supposes that the bed of the Solent was scooped out originally by a river, which from the extent of its drainage one may guess to have been little inferior to the Thames or Humber." He goes on to say that as soon as the sea had made a breach through the Dorset-Needles ridge, the Solent would lose its character as an estuary and assume that of a long narrow arm of the sea, and this would also convert the Isle of Wight from a peninsular into an island. Professor Rupert Jones has called especial attention to this subject in his paper on " Geology of the Kennet * " Geologist," 1862, p. 454,
