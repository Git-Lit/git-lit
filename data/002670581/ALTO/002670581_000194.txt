140 TERTIARY SERIES stitutes, formed of Ostrea flabellula, crowded together, with numerous other marine shells, many of which are of Barton types."* It may here be remarked that from the Chalk to Colwell Bay, round the base of Headon Hill, and passing over the Bagshot Sands, noted previously as unfossiliferous, with the exception of the remarkable leaf-bed, the shore is strewn with the debris of the strata. This has either fallen from above, or been washed by the sea from the yielding clays and sands. It lines the shore in heterogenous confusion. Large blocks of Limestone lie scattered here and there, from the semi-tufaceous to the more solid and compact kinds, all crowded with the fossil shells of Helix, Limnæa and Planorbis, and containing also seeds of Chara. The shells in the limestone are in an excellent state of preservation, but their fragile nature demands the utmost care in extracting them. Paludina lenta is found in groups on blocks of reddish-brown Septaria. " Chara Wrightii occurs abundantly throughout the Headon series, but especially in the bottom layers (Neritina bed) of the Middle Headon beds. (J. W. Salter.) The following shells were collected from the Venus bed in Cohvell Bay in December, 1852, by the Geological Survey : — Ostrea flabellula (crepidula of Deshayes) Venus incrassata (Sowerby) Cerithium cinctum Fusus labiatus Cyrena obovata Natica (epiglotum ?) * Mem.
