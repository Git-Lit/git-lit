the chalk marl. 97 of the Undercliff. These can be measured up to eighteen feet from the basement bed. A little distance beyond Mill Bay, Ventnor, on the shore west of Undercliff House, another good section of the lower beds of the Chalk Marl occurs, where the same fossils can be collected as at the former place. At St. Lawrence Shute, above the old Church, the Chalk Marl (up to about fifty feet from the basement bed) occurs in situ, the uppermost beds here having been eroded. The next beds in ascending order are about four feet from the Ammonites falcatus zone, and are two feet thick. They consist of a hard compact layer of marl, full of Ammonites varians, resting on a bed of softer material, which is also fossiliferous (A. Mantelli, Nautili, etc.) Above these a band of soft cream-coloured Marl, about four feet thick, occurs, with a hard compact band resting on its upper part. The fossils are changed into calcite. Turrelites undulatus, a well-marked large example of Ammonites varians, occur throughout these beds ; this latter form, with its varieties, being most characteristic of the Chalk Marl. The succeeding 25 feet of the Chalk Marl is sparsely fossiliferous, consisting, as it does, of hard limestone, intercalated with a soft argillaceous material. Above this series is a bed containing dark masses of what appears to be spongoid bodies ; we find also an Ammonite which apparently occurs neither above or below in the deposits, and which is probably Ammonites rugosa. The next in ascending order is a bed of soft argil laceous material about twelve feet thick ; resting on this is a band of compact marl, varying in places from six to nine inches in thickness. G
