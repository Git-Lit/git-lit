RED BEACH. 175 the smaller fragments from place to place, until finally they might drift into the westerly current which sets in along the southern shores of the Island, and be thrown up into the bays of which I have already spoken. Again, the Tertiary and Chalk strata may have been covered with vast beds of flint gravel, similar to that on Headon Hill, and on the Downs on the southern side of the Island. It may be fairly assumed that the red gravel is derived from the chalk flints, as these constitute about 95 per cent, of the deposit. The transparent pebbles of veined quartz and chalcedony, in some specimens clear as crystal, in others bright yellow, amber, dark brown or bluish black, have all a like origin, and the organic remains are seen in the Choanites, or Siphonia of the chalk formation. Dr. Mantell, in his " Wonders of Geology," states : "The Choanite, called by some lapidaries 'Petrified sea-anemones,' bears a close resemblance to the recent Alcyonia. The Choanite is of a sub-cylindrical form, with root-like processes, and having a cavity in the centre, which is often filled with hard chalk." Small pebbles of pure transparent quartz, or rock crystal, are found in the red shingle along the southern shores of the Island, and are named " Isle of Wight diamonds." " These have probably been washed out of the Wealden strata, for pebbles identical in mineralo gical character occur in the grits of Tilgate Forest and Tunbridge Wells ; but the shingle contains other silicious pebbles which essentially differ from those of the chalk flints. Some of these are composed of a dark brown mottled jasper, and when cut and polished
