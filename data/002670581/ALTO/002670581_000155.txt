WHITE CHALK. 107 are found upon examination to be shattered into frag ments. These fragments, or splinters, vary in size from three inches in diameter down to powder. The flints thus shivered, as if by a blow of incon ceivable force, retain their form and position in their bed. The chalk closely invests them on every side, and until removed nothing different from other flints can be perceived, excepting fine lines, indicating the fracture, as in broken glass ; but when removed they fall at once to pieces, the fragments being as sharp as possible, and quite irregular, being certainly not the effect of any peculiar crystallization or internal arrangements of the material, but solely attributable to external violence. This shattering is probably the result of the chalk upheaval, though to offer any definite cause to explain so curious a phenomenon is beyond the limits of this paper. The cliffs of Freshwater are crowded with sea birds â€” especially in the breeding season. They lay their eggs on the projecting ledges of the chalk strata, sitting tier above tier, and almost covering the face of the cliffs. Should a gun be fired, and the report disturb them, they form by their flight a thick cloud which almost darkens the air. Collecting these eggs was at one time a profitable occupation, and although one of an extremely dangerous nature, was followed by many persons. The manner in which the ledges were reached and the eggs taken was as follows : A pointed crowbar was inserted in the soil above ; a stout rope was secured to the bar, to which another rope was attached called a " guy," and which was carried in the hand of the person descending, for the purpose
