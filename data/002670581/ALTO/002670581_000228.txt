170 tertiary series. into the sea. This stream gives indications of having existed for a considerable period, during which time it has deviated from its original direction, leaving deposits of calcareous tuff as witnesses of its varied course. Twigs and stones collected by the moving water and added to the deposit (which, largely com posed of carbonate of lime, has hardened in course of time), have formed an interesting and instructive illustration of limestone formed in a chalk district by the agency of water. On the shore beneath the pier at Ventnor huge masses of rough-surfaced rocks so formed occur. They resemble the Limn√¶an Limestone of Headon Hill, or that of the east end of Whitecliff Bay, and are known as the " Lion Rocks.' The area over which this formation spreads is a wide one j its depth has not yet been ascertained, but during the erection of some houses in Mill Street, the workmen worked down a ten foot rod below the foundations without touching its base. The houses which have been built upon it stand firmly, its consolidation being perfect. The vegetable matter of the enclosed twigs and grasses has entirely disappeared ; they are quite hollow, and petrification has given them outwardly the appearance of stalacite. A section of this bed, showing the stratification, occurs in the low cliffs at the back of the Esplanade Hotel. The surface of some portions assumes a mammilated form. There is yet another example of the value of water as a consolidating agent. A mass oi conglomerate, commonly termed " Pudding Stone," occurs about 250 feet seawards from where the waterfall empties itself beneath the beach into the sea. This con glomerate is visible at half and low-water tides, in
