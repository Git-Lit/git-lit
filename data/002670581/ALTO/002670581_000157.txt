WHITE CHALK. 109 is extensively used as a pickle amongst the older inhabitants, and still forms a minor industry of the Island, although the task involves the same risk of life as the egg collecting. Shakespeare's unrivalled description of the cliffs at Dover would apply equally to those at Freshwater : " How fearful And dizzy 'tis, to cast one'B eyes so low ! The crows, and choughs, that wing the midway air, Show scarce so gross as beetles : half way down Hangs one that gathers Samphire ; dreadful trade ! Metbinks, he seems no bigger than his head : The fishermen that walk npon the beach, Appear like mice : and yon tall anchoring bark, Diminished to her cock ; her cock, her buoy, Almost too small for sight ; the murmuring snrge That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes, Cannot be heard so bigh." â€” King Lear, Act iv., Scene vi. The cliffs at Freshwater, like those on the opposite coast of Dorsetshire, have been excavated by the sea, and exhibit deep caverns and outlying masses. On the eastern side of the Bay, two isolated masses of chalk, which probably by reason of their superior hardness have long survived the destruction of the strata, of which they once formed a part, stand out boldly from the sea. One of these is called the " Deer Pound," the other the " Arched Rock," the latter forming one of the most important features of the place. The same agent that separated it from the adjacent cliff has tunnelled it through in the form of a rough arch, that from some points of view exhibits a singularly beautiful gothic outline, which, to be seen in its grandest aspect, must be viewed from the beach.
