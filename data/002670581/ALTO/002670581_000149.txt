WHITE CHALK. 103 : From these figures it will be seen that the Southern Downs are much higher than those of the central ridge and as the strata here are almost horizontal, wdiilst in the ridge they are more or less vertical, we can con sider the Southern Downs as the remnants of the central portion of the great anticlinal, or saddle, into which the Chalk has here been thrown. From the rounded and turf covered summit of these Downs a most imposing panorama is unfolded ; indeed, no other portion of the Island will better repay exami nation, both on account of its beauty and general interest. The view from Ashey sea-mark on that part of the Chalk Hills between Messly and Brading Down is particularly fine. This sea-mark is in form of a triangular pyramid, with its apex rough and broken. It was erected in 1735 to facilitate the navigation of the Solent between St. Helen's and Spithead. The view has been thus described by the Rev. Legh Richmond : â€” " Southward the view is terminated by a long range of hills (Shanklin, Wroxall, and Appuldurcombe), at about six miles distant. They meet to the westward another chain of hills, of which the one whereon I sit forms a link, and the whole together nearly encompass a rich and fruitful valley, filled with corn-fields and pastures. Through this vale winds a small stream for miles ; here and there lesser eminences arise in the valley, some covered with wood, others with corn or grass, and a few with heath or fern. One of these hills is distinguished by a church (New Church) at the top, presenting a striking feature in the landscape. Villages, churches, country-seats, farm-houses, and cottages are scattered over part of the southern valley.
