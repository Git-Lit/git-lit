THE LOWER GREENSAND. 32 part of the roof and sides of the cavern, and the fossils they contain are exposed in relief, consisting of the following: Ammonites, Trigonia DÃ¦dalea, Gervillia-anceps, etc., representing a kind of natural ornamented cave. I have stated that the lower portion of these deposits is highly interesting, on account of the number and variety of the fossils it contains, some of which do not occur either above or below in this series of deposits. Long tabular slabs, some of them measur ing six or seven feet long, and from a foot to eighteen inches thick, crowded with the long Pinna-like shell, Gervillia anceps, also G. aviculoides, frequently fall from the cliff to the beach. Besides the larger nodules, there are other smaller concretionary masses, some of which contain a number of small agglomerated shells, many of them appearing to be confined to these masses. There is another curious circumstance connected with the larger concretions, which, when broken, are found to contain many fossils. Besides these, they almost invariably enclose roundish sandy concretions of a buff colour, many of them crowded with, small shells, such as Venus, Rostellaria Thetis, Area, Ammonites-Deshayesii, Pterocera, Natica, etc. The Crackers group extends from below Atherfield High Cliff, ascending to the Atherfield Coast Guard Station. The lower part of this group is a brown clay and sand, about 25 feet thick, which contains (amongst other fossils) calcareous casts of Ammonites, and Astacus remains. It is called the Lower Lobster bed, and has always been remarkable for the number and beauty of these fossils (Astacus Vectensis), one of which is figured in Mantell's " Geology of the Isle of Wight;" it is also figured and described by Professor Bell,
