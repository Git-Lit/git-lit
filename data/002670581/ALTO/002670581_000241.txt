THE UNDERCLIFF". 183 the loosened clay below it, which, mixed with the fragments of rock detached from the great mass in its fall, and full of interstices formed by the different hard ness of its own several strata, was more rapidly washed away than when in its own bed. A second subsidence now took place ; while from above another mass gave way, and by its weight urged the first fallen rock still further towards the sea, whose waves, carrying rapidly away all those parts easily soluble, united with the other causes of destruction to bring down fresh ruins from the cliff above. In this manner it is evident that the Undercliff was formed, most rapidly at first, but gradually slower as the causes of destruction tended to counteract their own effects ; for, after every subsidence, the mass of fallen clay and rock formed itself into a more gentle slope, and which, extending higher up against the face of the clay cliff, tended to keep it from mouldering, while the declivity of the slope itself rendered the material already fallen less apt to slide. The action of the sea which washed away the clay from among the masses of rock at the bottom, caused those masses to come into closer contact, and by degrees forced them into a high and strong bulwark, while those rocks which had rolled further out, became long reefs, extending far into the water, and breaking in a great measure the force of the billows before they reached the shore. Vegetation now had time to cover the face of she ruins an d secured the surface of the slope from the effects of rain and frost ; while the springs gradually formed regular courses through the little winding valleys among the heaps of ruin. Thus was the Undercliff gradually brought to the state in which we now see it."
