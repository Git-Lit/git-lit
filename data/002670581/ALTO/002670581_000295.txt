237 ECONOMICS. Salt is made in small quantities at the Salterns, near Newtown, by the evaporation of the sea water : first by exposing it in shallow pits to the combined influence of the sun and wind, and then boiling the strong lime until salt is formed (Geological Survey, 1862, p. 108). The so-called Agates which are picked up on the beach on the south side of the Island, especially near Sandown and Ventnor, are in reality Chalk Flints, which owe much of their origin to the silicified remains of sponges and other organised bodies. The rich brown tints which these stones display are derived from the presence of iron. These stones take a very good polish, and are made into 'pretty brooches and other ornaments, which find a ready sale in the Island under the name of " Isle of Wight Pebbles." Many of the so-called Isle of Wight Pebbles are, however, not the produce of the Island, but are imported into this country in a polished and artificially manufactured state, from Germany and elsewhere. Mr. Billings, Mill Street, is the resident lapidary at Ventnor.* (See Geological Survey, 1862, p. 108.) â€¢ This subject is treated of at page 117 of this work.
