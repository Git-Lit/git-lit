178 DENUDATION AND LANDSLIPS. Erosion, in many parts of the county around Newchurch, has produced many immature valleys and rounded knolls ; one of these valleys runs parallel with the north side of the village, leaving an outlying mound called Vinnicombe Hill. Keeping to the edge of the valley, we reach Horringford Railway Station, which stands on a slope of the Lower Greensand, its surface covered with a thick bed of flints. Whilst excavating here for ballast, during the con struction of the Sandown and Newport Railway, some ironstone concretions were dug up, containing casts of Venus and Thetis, similar to those which fall from the top of the cliff at Shanklin. St. Catherine's Down — almost the highest elevation in the Island — has been entirely denuded of its Upper White Chalk, and to a great extent of the grey, and has for a capping the remains of the Chalk Marl, with a few scattered flints as vestiges of the beds now swept away. Yet the Downs westward of St. Catherine's are capped and flanked with flints, and do not appear to have suffered to so great an extent from denudation ; and the high land of Dunnose contains a portion of the Upper White Chalk in its highest point, showing how unequally the forces of upheaval and denudation have worked throughout the southern range of the Downs. Although the strata in the southern range is nearly horizontal, the beds of chalk, wherever exposed are much dislocated, and traversed by fissures often con taining clay, and exhibit generally a ruined and crumbled condition. The central ridge is depressed in places, and cut transversely by valleys, indicating, perhaps, that their excavation originated under the action of greater volumes of water than we see at
