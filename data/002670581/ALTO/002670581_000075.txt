little stairs point. 51 A number of the fossils appear to have been derived, whilst others seem to have been indiginous. Beneath the lower bed a seam of black, gritty substance occurs, with but few enclosed fossils. It is full of dark, shiny, water-worn pebbles, with quartz, jasper, scales of the Hybodus, and teeth, probably of Saurians. This seam is deposited on the Wealden clays and sands. Beyond the King's Head, at Sandown, the cliffs rise gradually to a high elevation. Between Small Hope Point and Sandown the section in the cliff is not so clearly seen, but the dip of the strata increases from 2° north of Shanklin Chine to 50 under the southern part of Royal Heath. The Perna Mulleti bed, marking the commencement of the Lower Green sand, as at Compton Bay and Atherfield, re-appears on the shore, with its characteristic fossils, under the Sandown Barracks. This bed, being generally covered with sand, can only be seen during the prevalence of certain winds, and at exceptionally low tides. At Little Stairs Point, north of Shanklin Chine, a bed containing Ostrea prionata and. Exogyra sinuata occurs. Westward of the Chine, fossils begin to appear in the fallen blocks on the shore, and between the projecting headland, jutting into the sea, and laved by the waves each recurring tide ; here projects Shanklin ledge, where numerous fossils can be collected at low water. Great interest is attached to the strata at Shanklin Point, from the existence of, at least, two new and perfectly distinct ranges of Gryphæa sinuata. The striking difference between beds of this strata, so near each other as those of Atherfield and Shanklin, bears upon the general question of the division and identification of strata in detached places.
