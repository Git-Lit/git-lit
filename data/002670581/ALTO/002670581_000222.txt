164 TERTIARY SERIES. limits of the portion of its bed which still remains can be traced on the surface by means of the greater luxuriance of the vegetation which it supports. The thick limestone of the Upper Headon series formed its banks on the east side up to the commencement of the lane, whence it extended on the south beyond its present termination on the edge of the cliff. Helix nemoralis, H. rotundata, Gyclostoma elegans, with occasional Bulimus lubricus and Pupa muscorum are the most abun dant land-shells, and occur throughout. In the loam are Succinea and Limnæa, and in the lower part a small Planorbis and fragments of Unio. In addition to the above the following shells were noticed by Professor E. Forbes, viz. : — * Helix arbnrstom (or Zua lubrica nemoralis) ,, pnlcliella Achatina acicnla Clansilia ,, ericetorum ,, cellaria Pisidium Limnæa palustris Succinea oblonga Cyclas ,, hispida ,, hor ten sis Subaerial Beds of St. Catherine's Down. " Beds partly similar in origin to those of Totlands Bay occur on the summit of the cliff, between Rocken End and St. Catherine's Down. In this locality the beds are formed of hard calcareous mud, derived apparently from the Chalk Down to the northward, and becoming more indurated and mud-like, as well as of a darker colour, towards the bottom of the deposit. * Mem.
