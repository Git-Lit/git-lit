CLAY WITH FLINTS. 121 are sometimes found on the shore, and are known as Mammilated Chalcedony, on account of their bubble shaped exterior, giving them a rounded or breast-shaped appearance. The inner surfaces of some specimens, after being cut and polished, bear marks resembling those of a hammer on new copper ; in this condition it is called " Hammered Chalcedony." The black flints contain chalcedony, the white flints none. The flints as seen at Culver Cliff and Sandown Bay end occur in place near the lower part of the White Chalk, and contain many different forms of silicified sponge ; the black flints occupy a position in the uppermost division of the White Chalk, and yield but few fossils. The sponges are not always easily detected, except when of a reddish colour from the infiltration of iron, otherwise they have become to a great extent incor porated with the investing flint. At Sandown is a vast accumulation of pebbles composed of broken flints, rounded by the action of the sea, repeated falls of debris making continual additions. The mass is prevented from drifting to a greater distance than about half-a-mile to the east along the shore by Culver Cliff, which at its eastern point puts far into the sea, and acts as a barrier. Sandown Bay may also be mentioned as a rich field for pebble collectors. The noble headland of Culver can only be seen to advantage from the sea, from which also the arrange ment of the successive strata is much more apparent than when viewed from the shore. The beautiful mutations of the cliffs will be seen to pass from the dull browm of the Wealden to the red colour of the Lower Greensand, thence from the dark grey of the Gault and Upper Greensand, and the dull drab beds
