138 TERTIARY SERIES. highly inclined position of the beds in the neighbour hood of the Chalk, the lower members of the formation are comprised, for the most part, within comparatively narrow limits, and the chief portion of the superficial area occupied by the Fluvio-marine series consists of the upper members of that group. The thick beds of Limestone in this formation thin out towards the north, and altogether disappear in an easterly direction."* Headon Series This series, best seen between the river Yar and the sea at the western extremity of the Island, and along the eastern bank of the river Medina, on the eastern extremity, consists of beds of fresh water, marine, and estuarine origin. They are 133 feet thick at Headon Hill, and increase to 175 feet at Whitecliff Bay.t They are well exposed also in Totland Bay and Colwell Bay, and are separated from the series next below by a thin ferruginous band. They can be traced across the Island as a narrow band immediately under lying the Bembridge Limestone. The characteristic fossils are : — Planorbis enomphalus Limnæa longiscata Paludina lenta Potamomya plana Potamides cinctus Cytherea incrassata The Headon series was subdivided by Prof. Forbes as follows : — 1. Lower Headon ; fresh aad brackish water shells, in which Cyrena cycladiformis is a marked shell. 2. Middle Headon ; intermarine. 3. Upper Headon ; fresh water and brackish beds. Uppermost marls with Cerithium lapidum. * Mem. Geol. Surv., Bristow, Isle of Wight, 1862, p. 58. t Bristow.
