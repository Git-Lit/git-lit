description of beds. 59 it is the habit of animals of such genera as Pinna and Panop√¶a to assume when alive. " ' After this a temporary change followed, when an influx of sand mingling with the calcareous mud, caused a state of sea-bottom peculiarly favourable to the presence of animal life. In this way were called into existence a multitude of species which were added to those w-hich had appeared before these. This was, in fact, such a state of sea-bottom as is now presented by great shell-banks ; but it does not seem to have lasted long, and new depositions of mud appear to have extinguished some forms, whilst others suffered from the change only in the diminution of their numbers. In the midst of this muddy epoch, a tem porary and peculiar condition of sea-bottom, forming what are now called The Crackers, called forth the presence of numerous mollusca, at first of various species of the genus Gervillia, Cerithium, Dentalium, and other univalves, which appear to have enjoyed but a brief existence (as species) in this locality, since similar conditions were never afterwards repeated. The greater number of the Gasteropodous mollusca of the English Lower Greensand are found within this very limited range. At the close of the deposition of this great mass of clay there was for a time a great multiplication of the individuals of certain Brachiopoda which had commenced their existence in the lowest beds. Thus Rhynchonella Gibbsii suddenly appear in immense abun dance, covering the bottom of the sea, and predomi nating over the animals among which it had previously been but thinly scattered. "'This lowest zone of Terebratula marks the com mencement of a new state of sea-bottom where sands
