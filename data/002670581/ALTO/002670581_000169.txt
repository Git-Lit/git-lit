CLAY WITH FLINTS. 119 of the Upper Chalk fossils. Amongst the sponges may be mentioned Choanites and Ventriculites. The Choanites are found in hollow nodules, in which the form of the fossil is retained, the original tissue showing as oxide of iron, whilst the tubes and branches are embedded in the mass. In other examples the sponge has been probably enveloped by a mass of gelatinous silex, and has subsequently decayed ; it is in this manner that the hollow nodules have been formed, These nodules, on being broken, are found to contain a little white or reddish brown powder, including some fragments of sdicified sponge, and other minute bodies ; while in other instances the cavity is lined with quartz and chalcedon}-. It frequently happens that only part of the sponge is permeated by silex, the other portion being a friable calcareous substance embedded in the Chalk. Certain sponges, such as Ventriculites, are often found in this state. Other organisms besides sponges form the nuclei of flint nodules. The original substance of the fossil is in many cases transformed into silex without destroying its most delicate structures. In some examples the enclosed organisms appear to have sometimes undergone no change, though often they have become silicified, and of these Foraminifera have already been noticed. The Choanites and Ventriculites Are much sought after by collectors and visitors ; they are cut and polished, both for cabinet specimens and for ornamental purposes. Mr. Billings, the resident lapidary, may be relied upon for supplying genuine specimens, as well as trustworthy information. Mention is made of this for the purpose of putting visitors on their guard, there being a quantity of worthless material offered for sale under the name of " Isle of Wight
