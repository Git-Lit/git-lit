76 THE UPPER GREENSAND. logical character as the bed below, but more compact, which, excepting the large Ammonites rostratus, contains but few fossils. Resting upon these beds is a thick bed of Rag, and seven alternating beds of soft sandstone, divided by another layer of large conical flattened concretions called by quarrymen " Whills," which contain fossils such as Limas, Pectens, Terebratulœ, etc. These again are succeeded by two bands of darkly streaked laminated sandstone containing a species of Cardiaster. with a Panopæa, this is called the " Black Band." Resting on it is a layer of Rag, with a bed of soft sandstone of a light grey colour, sparsely fossiliferous ; succeeded by another bed of Rag of one foot, which rests upon a band of light grey sandstone of about four feet thick ; it contains no fossils except large groups of semi-silicified sponge-like bodies. Another bed of hard blue Rag one foot thick succeeds this, upon which is deposited a thick bed of close-grained grey sandstone of great economic im portance, being in much requisition for building purposes, which, with a soft bed of the same material on the top, is about five feet thick. It is locally termed the "freestone bed," and is more compact and harder than the beds below it. This bed is quarried and sawn into blocks for quoins, etc., of buildings, and is conspicuous for its thickness compared with the other beds along the face of the cliffs which form the great wall of the Undercliff between Ventnor and Blackgang. It is from about 32 feet to 34 feet below the Lower Chalk. Next in ascending order is an upper bed of Rag one foot thick, on which rests the so-called "Firestone"
