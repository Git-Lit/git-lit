Middle I Freshwater and estuary marls-! 50ft. 4. Lower J (65ft. 170ft. " The Lower Freshwater and Estuary Marls may be distinguished by the presence of Melania muricata and Melanopsis carinata."* A stratum named the " Black Band " is marked by the " first appearance of a new series of fossils, of which Rissoa Chastelii is the first conspicuous represen tative," coupled with the disappearance of others. " It consists of nearly two feet of firm carbonaceous laminated clays, abounding in fossils. There are Paludina lenta, very numerous ; Rissoa Chastelii major, scarce ; Melanopsis carinata; Limnæa ; Planorbis obtusus, of large size ; a peculiar small Cyclas (C. Bristowii) which I have not met with elsewhere, and fish vertebræ. Impressions of the linear leaves of gramineous plants, occasionally large seed vessels, Gvogonites, and Chara medicaginula are found in it, and lumps of lignite. At its base is found a seam of Unio, containing well preserved specimens It appears to me, 1 a careful re-examination of this particular bed, that the Black Band does not offer any decided proof of the existence of a terrestial surface ; that is, a break in the strata denoting the commencement of a new • Mem.
