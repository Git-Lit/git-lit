JUNCTION BED. 55 tell of something riddled through and through by fistulina. They speak eloquently of their stormy wanderings over the sea."* In the Isle of Wight, as at Folkestone, it is well represented, exactly in the same position, and contains the same coniferous petrified wood, and animal, as well as mineral remains, in the clusters of pyrites, which are deposited thickly on the floor of the Bay to the east of the Gas House at Ventnor. The bed in this locality contains but few organic remains, which, as elsewhere, appear to have been derived. Here, and at the west end of Mill Bay, are the only places in this neighbourhood where it can be examined, as it is hidden beneath the shore until, with the rise of the strata, it makes its appearance beneath the Gault on the edge of the Landslip at east end, where large masses of it fall over the cliffs. It then disappears until the cliffs near Shanklin are reached, where, as elsewhere, it frequently falls to the shore in large blocks. Amongst the fossils found in this neighbourhood are : Reptilian remains (chiefly vertebræ) Fossil coniferous wood, full Claws of Hopoloparia, longimanus (?) Mya truncata Venus (species) Inoceramus (species) Ammonites of teredo and tistulina borings — lignite Astacus (species) The thin seam of iron sandstone, or junction bed, and the associated pyrites, so completely obstruct the downward passage of water, that drainage is rendered indispensable whenever it happens to occur near the surface in cultivated grounds, and the springing * Mackie, in the " Geologist," pp. Si, March, 1S60.
