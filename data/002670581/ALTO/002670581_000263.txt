THE HUMAN PERIOD. 205 "On the middle west Down, beyond Nunwell, Isle of Wight, facing the north and east, by kind permission from Lady Oglander, the owner of the estate, I removed about 15 inches of earth from the present surface on a spot I had previously marked, feeling convinced, from its peculiar shape (once, no doubt, an extensive mound or tumulus, but now flattened), and its faint outline of mixed chalk, forming a large circle, barely perceptible to the ordinary observer, on the ground ploughed up for cultivation, that something worthy of investigation lay hidden. " By compass I trenched the north, south, east, and west, when I quickly came upon a most compact body of flints, so placed that when the whole surface was uncovered, it bore the exact shape of a large mushroom, for upon examination I found it equal on all sides, from the apex to the outside of the circle, well put together ; in fact, like a solid paved causeway, measuring in diameter twenty-two and a half feet, and nearly two feet fourteen inches in depth in the centre of the flints, measuring down to twelve inches. Under this extraordinary mass of flints, and exactly in the centre of the circle, there was a round stone (not flint), as if placed to mark the centre and act as a guide round which the flints were to be placed to form a proper circle. Close to this stone was an urn or " passing cup," with two handles placed horizontally, the holes in each handle being so small as to suggest that it was intended to pass a string through for suspension. It only contained earth and a few chips of flint, stood upright, and is five and threequarters inches high, and eight inches in diameter, apparently of unbaked clay, with very rude diamond-shaped markings scratched on
