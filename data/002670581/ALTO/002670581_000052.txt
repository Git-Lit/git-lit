THE LOWER GREENSAND. 30 turtle remains, etc. It also contains crystals of selenite in its lower part, and nodules of septaria. The following miscellaneous fossils are found in the Upper bed : — Gervillia Forbesiana (sole- noides) Panopæa plicata ,, irregalaris Cypricardia nndulata Mactra Carteroni Corbula striatula Lima Cottaldina Grj-phæa sinuata Ammonites Deshayesii „ furcatus „ incerta Hemicardium Austeni Area Raulini „ inflatus Holaster complanatus „ Leopoldinus Serpula ? Nucula scapha Pinna Robinaldina Venus fenestrata „ (vermetus) polygonalis Nautilus saxbyii Turtle remains Vectensis Avicula lanceolata Judging from the distorted and waterworn appear ance of the larger fossils found in this bed, there is no doubt as to their having been derived from other strata, or subjected to great pressure from the over lying strata. Third Division (Second subdivision). The Crackers Rocks (about 85ft.) " The Crackers " is a local name, adopted, like many local names in other districts, to strata, etc., by geologists. They consist of two distinct zones, enclosed in a soft bed of sand and sandy clays. The Upper zone comprises, probably, the largest nodules, which are mostly conical and boulder-shaped. The two zones are divided into the Upper and Lower Crackers, and are from 15 to 20 feet apart. The Upper nodules, which lie about 1 to 4 feet below the top ofthe sand, consist of a coarse, compact, sandy
