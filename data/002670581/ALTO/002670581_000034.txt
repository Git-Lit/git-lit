20 wealden formation, 24. Hard bed of white and yellow sandstone, soft, clayey and ferruginous in the upper part, forming a passage into the overlying bed. 25. Hard cyclas band, in dark grey shales. 26. Dark grey shales, harder and more marly in the lower 13 feet. 27. Hard sandy bed, with lignite on the top. 28. Grey sandy marls, with nodules of argillaceous limestone. 29. Pale grey sandy marls, with a band of hard sandstone concretions. 30. Hard and irregular band of sandstone. 31. Black shale. 32. Concretions of yellow sandy limestone, clay ironstone, laminated with bright yellow sand : cypris and plants. 33. Large Unio and Cyclas : Paludina elongata. 34.
