WEALDEN FORMATION, 2 exposure of them in Sandown Bay. The lowest Wealden beds are those forming the shore at Brook Point. They consist of red and variegated marls, upon which lie numerous trunks and branches of coniferous trees, commonly called the " Pine Raft." The trees are completely mineralized, being converted into a black stony mass, containing a considerable quantity of iron pyrites ; they lie in a horizontal position, in every direction, broken up into rounded fragments, varying from a few inches to as much as two or three feet in diameter. Some of the trees still present traces of woody structure, the annular rings of growth being clearly visible, but others are con verted into pyrites, or into a black substance resembling jet. In the letters which Professor Webster — one of the earliest Geologists — wrote to Sir Henry Englefield, 1811-1813, when it was possible to speak of "that part of natural science called Geology," after describ ing the Wealden beds in the vicinity, he says, " On lifting up some of the sea weeds, which grew upon the shore between high and low water-mark, I was sur prised to find almost all the rocks below them composed of petrified trees." There is no evidence to show that the trees grew on the spot, but were doubtless drifted from a distance in the same manner as the trunks and branches of trees are brought down by the Mississippi, and other large rivers of the present day. Dr. Mantell, after repeated visits to Brook Point, arrives at the same conclusion : he says, " The trees are all lying pros trate and confusedly intermingled. There are no erect trunks, nor any other indication that the forest was submerged with its native soil, like that of the Isle of Portland. On the contrary, this accumulation of fossil
