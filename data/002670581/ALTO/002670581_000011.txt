V geologist. Some of the figured fossils are of my own collecting, others from the published writings of Mr. D. Sharpe and Professor Bell. I wish to express my thanks to Mr. Charles Ryan, who has most kindly given me his gratuitous help with the drawings of these fossils, and of some of the sections. My thanks are also due to Mr. Scott, the Ventnor Town-Surveyor, for the drawing of the section of the Upper and Lower Greensand, â€” in the measure ment and description of the strata and fossils of which I follow Mr. W. H. Fitton. I have had the assistance of Mr. Charles D. Sherborn in revising and preparing for the press that portion of the work extending from the Basement Bed of the Chalk to the Human Period. The kind permission of Dr. Woodward has enabled me to reprint my paper on the Upper Greensand, which appeared in the Geological Magazine for 1882 ; and from Mr. Charles Barrois' work, " La Cretacee Superieure " I have inserted some valuable notes res pecting the Chalk Formation. The fossils of the Upper Greensand were named by Mr. Etheridge. I would also express my indebtedness to Professor Thomas Wiltshire, for his advice and assistance, and for the loan of the blocks which appear in the letterpress. Let me hope that this work may be the means of further popularising a subject, the importance of which I feel strongly.
