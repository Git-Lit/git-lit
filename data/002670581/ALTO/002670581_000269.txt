APPENDIX. delation of rtjc fficologo of the Isle of SHtgljt to that of iurbeefe. kfl^r-F we look at a geological map of the South f Yg of England, we observe that the Chalk Range *^*-V*t on tne west °f the Isle of Wight ends '■^tP abruptly with the few outlying masses known */ • v * as The Needles. Passing further west the coast of the Isle of Purbeck presents similar features ; and the Chalk has approximately the same high northern dip. At the extreme west, omitting a small exposure of Lower Eocene strata, we find the Chalk to be continuous with the mass of that of South Dorsetshire. The whole of this long stretch of chalk is the remaining portion of an anticlinal fold, the trough of the syncline being buried under the Tertiaries of the Hampshire Basin. The break between the mainland and the Isle of Wight and between Alum Bay and Purbeck indicates in all likelihood the bed of an ancient river, which, probably receiving as tributaries, amongst many others, the Medina, Western Yar, Avon, and Southampton Water, ran eastwards, and passing through the breach
