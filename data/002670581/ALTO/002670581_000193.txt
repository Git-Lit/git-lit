headon beds. 139 Lower Headon Beds. The thick beds of limestone which occur in this division of the series at Headon Hill, thin out in Totlands and Colwell Bay, disappearing altogether at Whitecliff Bay. The bed of sand forming Warden Ledge in Colwell Bay is extremely fossiliferous, and is a representative of one of the beds of limestone at Headon Hill. The series consists of clays, marls, sands, and limestones, and has a thickness of 67 feet at Headon, diminishing to 40 in Whitecliff Bay. The best section is to be seen in Weston Chine. Middle Headon Beds. " Called the ' Upper Marine Formation,' in con formity with the arrangement of Professor Webster. These deposits, however, at Headon Hill, appear to have been formed under brackish water conditions, for although Oysters, Cytherea incrassata, Nucula deltoidea, Natica depressa, Buccinum labiatum, and other sea-shells are common ; the upper and lower beds abound in Potamides ventricosus, P. concabus, P. cinctus, Veritina concava Vematurs, etc. A short distance further north, in Colwell Bay, the upper and lower beds are still marked by the presence of brackish-water shells, but the central part assumes a distinctly marine character. Where it forms the base of the cliff it is ver-y favourably displayed for examination, and its marine character becomes strik ingly apparent in the large oyster-banks which it con-
