GORE CLIFF. 83 the north face is a tablet, recording the original purpose of its erection, by Michael Hay, Esq., which is, " To commemorate the visit of the Emperor Alexander of Russia to England, in 1814, and as a remembrance of many happy years' residence in his dominions." There is also another tablet affixed to its south face, by Lieut. H. W. Dawes, of the 22nd Foot, in memory of the English soldiers who fell in the Crimean war ; thus making the column do double duty. Retracing our steps eastward from Blackgang, where the great wall of the Undercliff terminates, and follow ing the road beneath the cliff, a fine section of the Upper Greensand and Gault is exhibited, beneath St. Catherine's Down, at Gore Cliff, both deposits attaining to their full thickness, viz., about 100 feet each. Further eastward, below the village of Niton, a gap occurs, through which, at some remote date, the road to and from the Undercliff has been constructed. On rounding a jagged shoulder of overhanging cliff between Niton Undercliff and St. Lawrence, we arrive at Cripple Path, and " on reaching its foot we wonder how it is possible for the track which we see striking away across the greensward to make its way up the seeming vertical precipice ; but, like the evils of life, they only appear insurmountable at a distance ; a closer examination shows hidden shelves and cunningly formed stairs, and other undreamt of facilities, by which the ascent is rendered wonderfully easy."* Near St. Lawrence Church another gap occurs in the cliff — analagous to that at Niton Undercliff — through which a road has been constructed leading to * Venable's Guide.
