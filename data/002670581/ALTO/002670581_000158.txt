110 CHALK FORMATION. A short distance from it, another imposing block occurs, called the " Stag Rock." Freshwater Cave, in the west side of the Bay, is formed entirely of masses of fractured rock, and access can only be effected at low water ; its entrance is an archway about three yards in diameter at the base, and some twenty feet in height. In these outliers, as in the cliffs generally, the layers of flint may be seen, marking the white chalk like black lines ruled diagonally across a sheet of white paper. To the east of the Bay is Nodes Beacon, and the cliffs take a gradual rise of 617 feet, equalling those of High Down. The western side of this beacon is called The Main Bench, the eastern side, The Nodes. The face of the cliffs is tunnelled by numerous cavities, through one of which a cold spring of fresh water constantly flows. Two of these tunnels — respectively 200 feet and 90 feet long — are called Neptune's Caves ; those known as " Lord Holm's Parlour, Kitchen, and Cellars," are interesting, for his lordship is said to have entertained his guests in them, when he was Governor of the Island, a century and a quarter ago. Bar Cave and Frenchman's Hole are each 90 feet long. Rye's Nest, above the beach, is said to be between 500 feet and 600 feet in length ; then come several others of which Preston's Bower alone deserves mention. Beyond the bold abrupt headland of Sun Corner is Scratchell's Bay, celebrated for its arched cavern, due again to the action of the sea ; this rises to an altitude of 400 feet, forming a half dome, beneath which, looking seaward, nothing meets the spectator's eye but the ocean, its restless waves rolling and tossing in apparent
