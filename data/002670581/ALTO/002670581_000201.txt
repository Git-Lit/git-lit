Its verdure was very rich, and many hundred sheep grazed upon its sides and summits. From the opposite shore of the same water, a large, sloping extent of bank was diversified with fields, woods, hedges and cottages.3 At its extremity stood, close to the sea itself, the remains of an ancient Church,1 still preserved as a sea-mark. Far beyond the Bay a very distant shore was observable, and land beyond it ; trees, towns, and other buildings appeared, more especially when gilded by the reflected rays of the sun.5 To the south-west of the garden was another Down, covered also with flocks of sheep, and a portion of it fringed with trees." At the foot of this hill lay the village,7 a part of which gradually ascended to the rising ground on which the Church stood. From the intermixture of houses with gardens, orchards, and trees, it presented a very pleasing aspect. Several fields adjoined the garden. On the east and north were a number of cattle pasturing.
