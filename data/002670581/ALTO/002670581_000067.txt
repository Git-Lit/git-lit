walpen and ladder sands. 43 noides, Terebratula sella, as also the following fossils, which are amongst the most characteristic found in this bed :— Ostrea (two species) Gryphæa sinuata Mvtilus lanceolatus Pinna (?) Nautilus radiatus Panopæa mandibula Fern fronds of Lonchopteris Mantelli Bones of reptiles Some of the fossils are encrusted with crystallised spar, and many are wholly converted into that sub stance, more especially the smaller Ammonites. These nodules were named "Captain Peturson's Nodules" by the old collectors, in Dr. Fitton and Captain Ibbetson's time. The Crioceras beds extend into the sea in a south easterly direction, in the shape of hard ledges, which follow the dip of the strata, and are often denuded, especially after an east wind of long duration, when the nodules are laid bare, and their fossil contents exposed amongst which, associated with other fossils, are the Crioceras, coiled up on the ledge in a level zone. They are also found at the base of the cliff, and in the bed of the stream which flows down the centre of Whale Chine, having fallen out of the cliffs forming the sides of the Chine. Ninth Division. The Walpen and Ladder Sands (42 feet) These sands consist of greenish and grey sand, with a layer of large nodules at the base, containing numerous fossils for about six feet. Above is a bed of variable thickness, composed principally of serpulæ,
