56 THE LOWER GREENSAND. out of water on the side of a hill has frequently indicated the presence of this bed, when it has been superficially covered up by drift. There are no good sections inland of the Lower Greensand. What there are are comparatively unim portant, and chiefly belonging to the Upper division. Most of the ridges between the central ridge and the southern range of Chalk Downs are composed of it, ranging from Sandown, and flanking the Vale of Newchurch, which village stands upon it, to Horringford Railway Station, where it is capped by a bed of flint gravel, of from four to six feet thick, below which is a section of the Lower Greensand, containing Venus, with other fossils, probably the equivalents of those from the ironstone nodules of Shanklin. But denuda tion has been so extensive in the Island — from the effects of which the surface is extremely irregular — that it is very difficult to trace the formations inland, except in a few pits, such as near Winstone, or in the railway cutting between Ventnor and Shanklin, which belong to the upper series. At Messly, one mile from Newchurch, in a lane to the right ofthe hamlet, leading up to an extensive chalk pit, the Lower Greensand appears, followed by the Gault, Upper Greensand, and Lower Chalk in succession. The Long Stone, on the Down north of Mottistone, is described as a block of hard ferruginous grit, twelve feet long, belonging to the Upper beds, and has been placed in its present position by artificial means. At Brook, the Lower Greensand deposits are seen in the banks by the roadside. Brook Church stands on a terrace of these deposits. In ascending the road past the Church, over Shalcombe Down, the Lower
