THE HUMAN PERIOD. 197 In the gardens of Steephill Castle, as well as in the grounds above, numerous pieces of bone, associated with oyster and limpet shells, have been discovered. The midden heaps seem to be scattered over a wide area. A few years ago some pieces of pottery were brought to light when cutting a new road through the Steephill estate above the Castle. They consisted of vases, one or two of which were scarcely damaged, and of a superior make ; others were coarser. In the upper part of the quarry, two or three feet beneath the surface, more of this pottery was found, with quantities of shells. A layer of angular flints also occurred, containing a few fragments of the Upper Greensand formation, upon which the layer rests ; and above this came a layer of dark coloured ashes, con taining rounded pebbles, "pot boilers," from the shore beneath, limpet, periwinkle, and other shells. Amongst these latter were a few oyster shells, resembling the "new ground oysters," at one time dredged off Ryde. At present few oysters are found in the Solent.' The same deposit contained broken pottery of coarse and fine workmanship; a few pieces of " Samian ware," iron nails, and bones, amongst which were those of the deer, sheep, ox, hog and horse. The late Mr. H. Westropp published the following description of the place and its contents: â€” "Among the many instances of an early stage of rude civilisation in the Undercliff are the " kitchen middens " which so frequently occur in different parts of it. Extensive traces of one of these, and a fire place in connection with it, have been very recently discovered by Mr. Hodder Westropp, assisted by Mr. Norman, on the upper part of the new road winding up the cliff,
