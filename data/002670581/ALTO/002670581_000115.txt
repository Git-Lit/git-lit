81 CLIFF FISSURES. under St. Catherine's Down about 155 feet. But it is doubtful as to whether the lower 55 feet does not belong to the Gault formation. The Upper Greensand, as well as the other members of the Cretaceous system, owe their present conforma tion to the rise of the Wealden formation. It was during the process of the upheaval that they became divided into vertical fissures throughout. This phe nomena is plainly exemplified all along the great wall of the Undercliff, from Luccombe on the east, to Blackgang 011 the west. These fissures also occur in the quarries, and wherever the strata is exposed. The cliffs which form the wall of the Undercliff are a remarkable instance of the power of the elements in wearing away the strata, as, facing the south, they are exposed to the full force of the South-west gales, which rage at times with great fury, driving before them volumes of fine drizzly rain, excavating the lower beds of soft micaceous sandstone, and honey combing the layers of blue limestone (local rag), thus causing vast masses — divided by the vertical fissures already spoken of — to topple over with a crash ; such "founders," as they are locally called, sometimes represent many tons of debris. The Upper Greensand is exposed in several places on the northern face of the Southern Downs, forming picturesque inland cliffs with a step-like projection beyond the superincumbent chalk, as on the west side of St. Catherine's Down, the northern side of Appuldurcombe Down, below Worsley's Obelisk — known as Gat Cliff, and the north and east sides of Shanklin Down, below Cook's Castle. This Castle was originally erected as an object in the view from F
