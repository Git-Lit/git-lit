100 chalk formation. Ammonites varians have been collected. The Chalk Marl also occurs in a pit to the left of the path leading over the Down from Ventnor to Wroxall, opposite the lane leading to the village. Westward from thence, around the base of the Down, is another disused pit, in which all the Chalk Marl fossils before mentioned occur. At Morton, at the foot of Brading Down, near the Roman Villa, an extensive chalk quarry is worked for lime burning, and fossils from the upper beds of the Chalk Marl may sometimes be obtained of the workmen. A good section of these deposits is exposed here, at the mouth of the pit, showing the high angle to which the strata have been elevated. Further north, at Messly, a lane leads up from the village to a large chalk pit, in which the Lower Green sand, Gault, Upper Greensand and Chalk Marl are passed over in succession in the road. Sections of each are also exposed in a bank on the right, the strata having been cut through in forming the road. At the pit, the junction of the Grey with the Upper White Chalk is exposed, showing the position of the Chalk Rock. Several pits also occur along the foot of Arreton Down, all being worked into the Chalk Marl (in its upper part) and the Grey Chalk. Along the base of the central ridge, westward, in the road leading up from Mottistone to Shalcomb, the same uniformity occurs in the strata as at Messly, all the deposits before-mentioned occuring in the same order of suc cession, and sections of each can be seen on both sides of the road. The junction of the chalk with flints with the Chalk Rock is well exhibited in a pit at the end of Shalcomb Down, This is a band of hard
