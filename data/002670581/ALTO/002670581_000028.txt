WEALDEN FORMATION, 14 Lyall makes the following statement : ' That we cannot hesitate to refer the whole to one great delta, even then the magnitude of the deposit may not exceed that of many modern rivers. Thus the delta of the Quorra, or Niger, in Africa, stretches into the interior for more than 170 miles, and, it is supposed, occupies a space of more than 300 miles along the coast, thus forming a surface of more than 25,000 square miles, or equal to one half of England.' "* The soil which composes the surface of the Wealden in the Island does not appear to be cultivated to any great extent as arable, being chiefly meadow land, like the same formation in Sussex and Kent. Trees and shrubs flourish and grow, dotted in clumps and rows over the landscape ; most of it being a poor damp soil, consisting of clays and sands. The low ground is marked by the presence of rank grasses and rushes. At Sandown, the inhabitants who lived in the lower part of the village at the beginning of the present century were, many of them, subject to attacks of ague ; but since it has grown into a town the im provements and the systems of drainage adopted have banished all the evils attendant upon a damp and unwholesome soil, and ague is in consequence a thing of the past. Sandown is at present as healthy a town as any of the sea-bound watering places on the Island.
