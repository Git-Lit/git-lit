1 68 TERTIARY SERIES. of iron. Of the nuts the pericarp only is preserved, but these may be obtained in large quantities. Prof. Webster, in a letter to Sir Henry Englefield states : — " It was near this place (Compton Chine) that I had been informed fossil fruits had been found in great abundance, and which were vulgarly called ' Noah's nuts.' I made it a point of endeavouring to see them in situ. Near the top of the cliff lie numerous trunks of trees, which, however, were not lodged in the undisturbed strata, but buried 8 or 10 feet under sand and gravel. Many of them were a foot or two in diameter, and ten or twelve feet in length ; their substance was very soft, but their forms and lignous fibre were quite distinct. Round them were a con siderable quantity of small nuts, that appeared similar to those of the hazel." " The sand based upon the Wealden red mottled clay, contains numerous hazel-nuts (called ' Noah's nuts ' by the people of the Island) and the remains of beetles mixed with matted fragments of the twigs and branches of trees. The latter, which are sometimes coated with phosphate of iron, retain their original shapes and general appearance, and are saturated with water, which on evaporation leaves a light shrivelled substance behind. The largest fragments, when first found, do not exceed two or three inches in diameter."* The tree remains at Brook Point are of Wealden age, not of the same age as those just quoted. They are much larger, and are completely mineralised by silica and pyrites into a hard black stone, susceptible of polish. The remains of buried trees can be seen • Mem. Geol.
