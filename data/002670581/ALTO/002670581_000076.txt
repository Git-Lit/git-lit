52 the lower greensand. the Point, at Shanklin, concretions of ironstone may be observed, full of fossils in a state of cast. I think it very probable that the strata, with its fossil contents, between Cliff End and Walpen Chine, are the equiva lents of those west of the Chine at Shanklin, but as the beds east and west of Shanklin Point have not been investigated with the view of comparing them and their fossil contents with those of Atherfield, I must leave the matter an open question at present. Most of the fossils found in the concretions are not in a good state of preservation ; still, they can be identified Amongst the most prominent are the following : — ■ Ostrea sinuata Rostellaria Trigonia dædalea'i ,, alæformis In Perna vironstone Venus parva nodules. Thetis minor A grey, gritty seam, near the top of the cliff, encloses concretions of fossils which much resemble those in the Crackers, but differ in mineral composi tion, the shells chiefly being transformed into cal careous spar, and having a coating of white powder on their outsides. The following are a few of the most characteristic : — Rostellaria (spec.) Gervillia alæformis Trigonia dædalea ,, alæformis Ostrea carinata Gryphæa sinuata Scalaria (spec.) Ammonites Deshayesii Terebratula tamarindus And others. In blocks of dark coarse sand are found groups of Echini (spec), Terebratula sella (?•) elongata, and T. celtica (?).
