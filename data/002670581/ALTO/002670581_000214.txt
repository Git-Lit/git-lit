Neither does it seem that the strata composing the Hempstead series are sufficiently dis tinguished by any striking peculiarities from the other Fluvio-marine deposits to be made a separate forma tion. In fact the evidence tends rather to show that the entire Fluvio-marine series consists of alternations of freshwater, estuary, and marine deposits, characterised by the presence of certain shells, some of which are common to several of the formations ; and that the whole thickness of these accumulations, extending from the base of the Headon Beds to the highest beds of Hempstead, were deposited in uninterrupted succession, without the intervention of a break from first to last."* The following are the fossils! of Hempstead Series : — Chara, 3 species Caudoni Forbesii Ostrea callifera Cardium Cerithium, 8 sp. Limnæa, 2 or 3 sp. Melania, 5 sp. Melanopsis, 2 sp. Murex Forbesii Natica labellata Nematura parvula Neretina, 2 sp. Paludina lenta Planorbis, 2 sp. Rissoa Chastelii Voluta Forbesii Corbula, 2 sp. Cyrena, 2 sp. Cytherea Lyellii Modiola Prestwichii Mya (Panopæa) minor Nucula Tellina Unio, 2 species The middle Freshwater and Estuary Marls of Hempstead are so hidden by landslips and mud streams that persons desiring to collect fossils should confine collect fossils should confine their search to the dry weather periods, otherwise, owing to the soft tenacious character of the soil, such a task becomes almost impossible. * Mem.
