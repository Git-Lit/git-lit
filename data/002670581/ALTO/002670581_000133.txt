THE chalk marl. 95 fore only been able to take measurements in separate localities, by tracing the zones from the basement bed or Fossiliferous Chalk Marl, up to the Grey Chalk. The Chalk Marl. Commencing at the base, we find the fossiliferous Chalk Marl, and resting upon it are two thin bands of hard impure limestone, full of black grains. These two beds have a united thickness of one foot. Thev indicate a change in the lithological character of the deposits below, and an approach to the Chalk above. The characteristic fossils are, Ammonites varians, Turrelites Bergeri, and Ostrea Carinata. They also con tain groups of organisms, cylindrical in form, and reticulated on their surfaces, which have been termed by Dr. Mantell " fossil corals," supposed to belong to the genus Mellepora.* The next seventeen feet consists of impure sandy limestone of a bluish grey and buff colour, hard and irregular bands apparently dividing it up into three beds. The fossils are, Ammonites Mantelli, A. varians, Ostrea vesicularis, Pecten Beaveri (which makes its first appearance here), Ammonites peramphts, a large Turrellite, T. Tuberculatus; but these latter two appear to have been derived, judging from their smooth and water worn appearance. Resting upon these are two thin beds of hard cream-coloured marl, the lowermost one varying in thickness from six inches to one foot, and containing nodular masses in an argillaceous deposit. â€¢ Fossils of the South Downs.
