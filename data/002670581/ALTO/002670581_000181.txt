LOWER BAGSHOT SERIES. 129 Lower Bagshot Series " The junction between the London Clay and the Lower Bagshot beds is clearly shown in Whitecliff Bay, the former being represented there by ferruginous brown clay, and the latter by pale grey sands weathering nearly white, and containing occasionally thin laminæ of pipe clay. Thirty-seven feet of these sands, clays, and pipe-clays intervene between the upper part of the London Clay and a band of sandstone which runs out to sea at the base of the yellow micaceous sands which constitute the greater portion of the Lower Bagshot series there. Above them is a bed of rounded pebbles of flint 18 inches thick."* These beds are unfossiliferous both at Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay, with the exception of the Pipe Clay band at the former. The Bagshot beds between the London Clay and the Fluvio Marine series were first named and divided by Mr. Trimmer, of the Geological Survey, in 1850, into Upper, Middle, and Lower, which divisions have since been adopted and retained. The Lower Bagshot beds are 660 feet thick in Alum Bay. They consist of a series of variously coloured unfossiliferous sands and clays, with alternating beds of iron sandstone, and clays with leaves, seeds, and seed vessels of plants, indicating a sub-tropical climate. About 20 genera, and over 50 species of plants were named by De la Harpe and Salter, and some of them were figured in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey for 1862. The entire work of classifying these Tertiary plants has been undertaken by Mr. Starkie Gardiner, who is » Mem. Geol. Surv., Bristow, Isle of Wight, 1862, p. 39. I
