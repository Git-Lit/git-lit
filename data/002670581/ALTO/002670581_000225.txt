st. Catherine's down. 167 In addition to the displacement of flints on the Down the chalk from which they have been derived, and in many places the strata forming the face of the Undercliff have been denuded as far down as the Chloritic Marl and Upper Greensand. The strata cresting the cliff is composed of Chert, Sandstone, and Rag, which, by some unknown agency, have been split and divided into layers, the beds broken into flat masses to a depth of 8 to 10 feet from the surface, and in places becoming imbedded in the before-mentioned drift. Contraction caused by the evaporation of the water held by the rocks may account for the jointing, or even frost. These alluvial and surface deposits bring us to that period which differs but little from our own, and which supplies the first evidence of the existence of man. The Island, unchanged in form, presents now as then the well-known features of English landscape — rich meadows and fertile valleys, their rivers, whether rapidly rushing or gliding slowly, still bear and deposit their gathered burdens, depositing them at their mouths, silent records, which in future ages will act as inter preters of the past. The alluvial meadows are mostly composed of silt, containing rushes and branches of trees intermixed with land and freshwater shells. An alluvial deposit — its original extent much diminished by the inroads of the sea — lies to the north-west of Brook Chine ; it has been drained, its escaping water forming a chine, at the head of which an excellent section is sometimes visible. This bed contains remains of hazel trees, some of large growth, and retain their bark, but other wise shew as little more than decayed wood of a rusty ochreous colour, being highly impregnated with oxide
