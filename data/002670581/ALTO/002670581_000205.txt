bembridge series. 149 The shore near the Point is studded with blocks of limestone containing casts of Limnæa, Planorbis and the small fossilised seed vessels of Chara Gyroginites. The collector, if not fastidious as to the quality of his specimens, will not be troubled on the score of quantity, the organic remains being most abundant. In the marls, myriads of a species of Cerithium are found with the shells destroyed, and the internal whorls filled with the substance of the enclosing beds. The Limestone yields some fair specimens of Planorbis, Cyrena obtusa, Melania striata, Paludina, Limnæa; and in the upper portion there is a bed in which, together with other fossils, Oysters occur. The waters under which these strata were formed must have teemed with animal life, and although (with the exception of the Oysters, which are well preserved with both valves in contact) the fossil remains are of no great value for the cabinet, yet as affording oppor tunities of study and comparison, they are most interesting. It was near the point that a palm leaf was discovered by Dr. Mantell. The deposits in Whitecliff Bay have a total thick ness of 20 feet ; their characteristic fossils re-appear inland, associated with and sometimes replaced by new species. Limnæa and Planorbis are constant throughout. At Dodpits and Stony Cross Paludina orbicularis and Bulimus ellipticus are found ; the finest specimens of the latter shell are found at Sconce. The Bembridge Limestone at the top of Headon Hill has apparently undergone denudation, and is hidden by a deposit of chalk and sand. " On the north side it appears in the face of the cliff, and is displayed better than at Sconce or Cliff
