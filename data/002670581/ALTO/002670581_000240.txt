182 DENUDATION AND LANDSLIPS. No description of the origin of the Undercliff sur passes the following, by Sir Henry Englefield : â€” " This tract, which is of various breadths, from a quarter to half-a-mile, at present exhibits a series of irregular terraces, each supported by vast fragments of rock bounded by a high wall of cliff towards the north, and in general terminated towards the sea by a very broken and indented line of cliff. The whole forms a vast mass of confused ruins, in which no regularity of strata or materials can be traced. To account in any degree for this singular appearance, it will be necessary to recur to that period, remote beyond all reach of history, when, by some great convulsion, this island was exposed to the sea in one vast range of perpendicular cliffs, such as would now appear if the whole Undercliff were removed from the wall of rock above it. The clay and sand strata attacked at their foot by the waves of the sea, in their front by wind, rain, and frosts, and above all, softened and washed away by the numerous springs which issue from under the rock, very soon became incapable of bearing the vast weight incumbent on them. The rock (divided by numerous periodical fissures^ began to part at the fissure nearest to its front, gradually subsided and slipped in an in clined position (or perhaps sometimes, though not often, fell over) until its progress was stopped by th e slope of clay on which it moved. But though at rest f< <r a time, the same causes which set it in motion would again press it forward to the sea. Its fall had left a great front of rock and clay bare, while its upper surface formed a basin, in which the waters of the springs collected into a pool, moistening still more effectually
