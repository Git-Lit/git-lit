Å’fce Uentnor Collection. \^Jt\\ ATING from the formation of the present @| h"|) Museum at Newport, in 1854, I am not if aware of any recorded attempt of the inhabi- i^Atj). tants of any of the other towns in the Island T&* besides Newport, and latterly Ventnor, to establish either a Museum or even the nucleus of one ; to the latter Ventnor can only at present lay claim, as the only available space is around the walls of the Hall of the Literarv Institute, which are utilised for the purpose by the erection of spacious wall cases, occupying nearly- the whole length of the Hall, and are filled with several tiers of shelves, on which the fossils from the formations of the different divisions of which the strata of the Island are com posed are arranged and named in the order in which they occur, so that the contents can be examined seriatnmm The following formations are represented : 1. The Wealden case contains Saurian reptilian remains with the mollusca, consisting of univalve and bivalve shells. The shelves above contain numerous specimens from the Lower Greensand and its divisions, after Dr. Fitton.
