189 GORE CLIFF. Several minor slips have taken place during the last 30 or 40 years. Beneath Gore Cliff, hetween Niton and Blackgang, is an enormous mass of rock, as large as a good sized cottage. It once formed part of a large pinnacle which had become loosened from the cliff and overhung in a manner extremely threaten ing to the safety of the public. The authorities decided upon its removal by means of gunpowder. In its fall it carried with it tons of adjacent rock and debris, entirely blocking and destroying the roadway made round the landslip of 1799. A new road has since been constructed, and the rock alone remains as evidence of the past destruction. On visiting the spot soon after the occurrence, I noticed an extensive rift in the Gault ; it measured about 100 yards in length. It had been formed apparently by one portion of the strata slipping over the other as it moved onwards towards the sea. The surfaces of each were polished, assuming that peculiar glassy and striated appearance called by the miners " slickensides." Similar conditions are sometimes to be seen in the chalk. Surfaces thus acted upon will preserve their polish for some length of time, and owe their condition to the friction caused by the moving rock mass. This constant fall of land and consequent encroach ment of the sea necessarily reduces year by year the circumference of the Island. From personal observa tion I am enabled to state that between Ventnor and Bonchurch, where the strata, composed of Chalk and Greensand, possesses a certain amount of resisting power, the sea has encroached rather more than 12 yards during the last thirty years, The springs are
