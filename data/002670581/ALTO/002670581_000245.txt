187 PITLANDS FARM. The destruction of these upper strata is continually going on, and it is only when by some cause more violent than usual, great masses fall, that it forces itself upon the notice and becomes recorded. The The upper strata are also much jointed, thus offering a ready entrance for water and the subsequent action of frost. One slip formed a narrow gorge, almost exposing the underlying Lower Greensand. Similar slips appear inevitable, and the road above the cliff has been destroyed more than once. This might possibly be prevented by a more careful system of drainage, which would carry off the surface water to some degree, and prevent the separation of the upper beds. Referring to the landslip of 1799, which took place after a protracted frost, a farm, known as Pitlands, fell from the cliff into the sea, together with the rocks, trees and other vegetation in its neighbourhood. The following is an account of the catastrophe in a letter dated, Niton, February 9th, 1799, appeared in the " Isle of Wight Magazine " of the same year : — " Dear Sir,— Yesterday I was desired by your tenant, farmer Harvey, to go down to Pitlands, to take a view of your cottage their, in order to communicate to you what follows.
