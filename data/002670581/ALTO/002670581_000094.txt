68 THE LOWER GREENSAND. and the remaining strata to Atherfield Point, would require the time extended to obtain even a passing knowledge of the beds and their fossil contents. But it happens, in the majority of cases, that the visitor is limited to time, and makes what is not inaptly termed " a flying visit," often resulting in disappointment, as it is next to an impossibility for anyone either to gain a knowledge of the strata — even in a general way — or to collect their organic remains, as the chances are they may find a few of the most common, or, mayhap, some of the rare specimens, or they may return with an empty bag, which is often the case. Another obstacle is frequently presented by the red shingle being heaped up by the sea at the base of the cliffs, and covering the shore to a considerable depth. This shingle has been worn by the surge to such a degree of smoothness and mobility, that the foot sinks and slides at every step, progress being slow and laborious^ This, combined with the continual wasting and disin tegration of the sandy and clayey cliffs above, every rock containing fossils becomes covered up and hidden from the view. This statement may also be applied to the Crackers division. The Bays are all open to the south, the sun's rays being concentrated by reflection, so that the heat at the base of the cliffs in the after part of the day is reflected, and greatly increases the feeling of exhaustion. Even the keen collector, by the time Atherfield is reached (if not before) will begin to feel he has had enough, and will probably ascend at the Point, return ing on top of the cliff.
