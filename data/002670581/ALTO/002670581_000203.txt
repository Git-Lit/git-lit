BEMBRIDGE SERIES. 147 exposed and measured by the Survey officers. They are usually much concealed by small land-slips. They seem to contain many fossils of the same genera and species, common to the later Tertiaries. It is probable that the wasting away of the Clays causes the Lime stones to give way from loss of support, and the general wreck of the strata hides its original arrangement. Upper Eocene. The Bembridge Series. The classification proposed for this series by Prof. Forbes, in 1856, is still retained. He takes them in descending order, as follows : — 1. Upper Bembridge Marls. 2. Lower ,, ,, 3. Bembridge Oyster Bed. 4. „ Limestone Bed. These strata are most important. In the introduc tion to Prof. Forbes' Memoir, he states : — "All geologists without exception who have com pared the section at Whitecliff Bay, at the east end of the Island, with that of Headon, in the west, have regarded the Fluvio-marine series in the former place as the equivalent of that in the latter. No one seems to have suspected that the Fluvio-marine beds at Whitecliff were in considerable part superior to those of Headon Hill." And he further supple ments this note by two diagram sections in illustration.
