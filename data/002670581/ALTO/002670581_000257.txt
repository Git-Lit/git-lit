THE HUMAN PERIOD. 199 doubtless the relics cast aside by the primitive savage when he had finished his meal. The Roman pottery found in the heap must have been obtained in the manufactories established in the south of England or in the Island, and had been used bv the early inhabi tants in their primitive cooking place. The site of a Roman manufactory was discovered near Barnes Chine, in the parish of Brixton, on the authority of the late Mr. Kell. These kitchen middens must evidently date from a period when the Romans were still in the Island. This, however, is not the only instance of civilization and barbarism being in close proximity." Many midden heaps, however, have been discovered containing no relics of Roman pottery. For instance, in the Grove Road, below the Railway Station, when excavations were being made on the site of the present Clarendon Hotel, the workmen came upon one of these heaps, consisting of limpet shells and bones. A cooking stone, and some lower jaws, a thigh bone, and other remains of human beings were found within a short distance, but no pottery of any description. The jaw and thigh bone were broken, the latter across the middle. The lower jaw contained four or five molar teeth much worn ; they were pronounced by those familiar with the subject to be those of a deformed, low-typed savage of gigantic stature. The skull was too decayed for preservation, but the jaw bones were placed in the museum of the Ventnor Institute. Mr. Westropp also records the discovery of a kitchen midden at Underwath, St. Lawrence, containing a cooking-stone over a heap of charcoal and ashes. No stone or flint implements have been found amongst the remains from the Undercliff, except at Bonchurch,
