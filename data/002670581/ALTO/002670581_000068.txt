the lower greensand. 44 associated with Terebratida sella and other shells. About 200 yards east of Walpen Chine a bed of hard grey gritty rock commences on the shore, running upwards, and following the direction of the stratum, large blocks of which are frequently detached from the cliff, and fall on the shore. These blocks contain rounded masses of a dark chocolate colour, and are often crossed by lines of spar. These concretions are from six inches to a foot in diameter. They are sometimes found loose on the shore, having been detached from the grey rock by the wash of the sea. They are enclosed in an outer coating, which, on being broken, discloses an inner mass, from which I have obtained the following fossils : — Venus Vectensis Thetis major Ammonites Deshayesii Small ancylocerus (? Toxo- Terebratula sella Ammonites Martini ceras) Tenth Division. Upper Gryphæa Group (16 feet). In the lower twelve feet of sands and clays — some of which are ferruginous and oolitic, similar to those already noticed as forming group 4 — there are three or four ranges of Exogyra sinuata (large oysters). This shell also occurs in the greenish sand forming the upper portion of this, which marks the limit of its range, in an upward direction. Small fragments of vegetable remains occur, not only in these beds, but nearly throughout the entire formation. In the lower
