SANDOWN BAY. 11 that it is rare to meet with specimens in a perfect condition. But few examples of verterbræ in juxta position have been found, with the exception of the sacrum, which are anchylosed. Dr. Wilkins also records how he obtained large portions of the lower jaws, with teeth, of an adult, also a fragment of the jaw, with teeth, of a young Iguanodon, besides detached teeth. Dr. Mantell records a leg and thigh bone from Sandown Bay as being upwards of nine feet, and a thigh bone three feet four inches in length. The femur of an Iguanodon, four feet ten inches long, and fourteen inches in diameter near the middle, was found in Sandown Bay. The total extent of the coast occupied by the Wealden formation in Sandown Bay is a mile-and-a-half ; owing, however, to the absence of cliffs over a great part of the coast, where the Wealden strata occur, the beds there are rendered somewhat obscure. They may, however, be seen on the strand at low water, cropping out in succession, and consisting of alternations of ridges of sandstones, clays, and marls, similar to those described on the other side of the Island. The Pine Raft, so conspicuous at Brook Point, is rarely visible at Sandown Bay ; but is reported to have been visible by the Geological Survey during the summer of 1858 — a circumstance of much interest, proving it to be, not a mere local deposit, restricted to a limited area round Brook Point, but to have extended from west to east, over a distance of at least fifteen miles, in a direct line. During the many years I have visited the Bay, I have never had the opportunity of seeing it. It would be useless at this time to attempt to describe the position of beds contiguous to the town, as they
