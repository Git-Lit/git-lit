LOWER GRYPHÆA. 37 The last subdivision (7) consists of a brown plastic clay containing the following miscellaneous fossils : — Panopæa plicata Corbula s'rintnla Gervillia lingaloides Lima Cottaldina Rostellaria Robinaldina Cardium Cornuelinnnm Isocardia ornata Area Raulina Nucula spathulata Venus Vectensis I „ glabra ! Serpula (Vermetns) poly- gonalis Fourth Division. Lower Gryphæa (Exogyra Group), 32 feet. Perna alæformis Gryphæa sinuata Terebratula sella Gervillia alæfor^iis (Perna Sowerby) Lithodomus oblongus „ Gibbsiana A bed of brown ferruginous coloured sand, 20 feet thick, forms the base of the Lower Gr}'phæa group, and is overlaid by two feet of sand, containing Perna alaformis, but chiefly remarkable for the great abun dance of Terebratula sella, one group of which is much larger than the other. I believe the larger species to overlie the smaller in the cliff. This fossil, although occuring in the other beds — that is, the Perna and the Upper beds — is nowhere so plentiful as here ; indeed, the absence of Terebratula is remarkable all through the Crackers group : whilst at the base of the Lower Gryphæa group large blocks often fall from the cliff, almost wholly made up of the Terebratula sella, embedded in a greyish sand. The bed, with Exogyra sinuata, comes to the shore under Atherfield High Cliff, and is the next in succession. At the point where it comes to the base of the cliff it is about two feet thick.
