ITS LAND AND CLIMATE. 15 remarks on the physical geography, and the nature of the fauna and flora, of the country inhabited by the stupendous reptiles, whose fossil remains have so long engaged our attention. " From the nature of the alluvial sediments accu mulated in the lapse of innumerable ages in the deltas and estuaries, which now constitute a great part of the area of the south-east of England, and of the north of Germany, a general idea may be obtained of the aspect of the country through which the river flowed, and the character of the superficial strata : and from the fossil remains we may learn the nature of the trees and plants which clothed its soil, and of the animals that roamed over the land, or inhabited the waters. "Whether that country were an Island or a Continent cannot be determined ; but that it was diversified by hills and valleys, and irrigated by streams and rivers, and enjoyed a climate of a higher temperature than any part of modern Europe, is most evident. Coniferous trees in all probability clothed its alpine regions ; palms, arborescent ferns, and cycadeous plants, constituted the groves and forests of its plains and valleys ; and in its fens and marshes the equisetace√¶, and plants of a like nature, prevailed. That the soil was of a sandy character on the hills and elevated grounds, and argil laceous in the plains and marshes, may be inferred from the vegetable remains, and the materials in which they are imbedded. Sands and clays every where prevail throughout the Wealden formation, and have probably resulted from the decomposition of micaceous and felspathic rocks. " Some inferences also may be drawn as to the
