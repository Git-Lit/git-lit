78 THE UPPER GREENSAND. This division also contains three or four beds of black and dark grey flinty chert, the lowermost of which is about two feet thick, and called by Dr. Mantell "coarse chalcedony." The upper beds are crowded with spicula of sponges. Besides these, there are several thin bands of white brittle chert, apparently siliceous, and breaking into square fragments. This series of deposits is very sparsely fossiliferous, the fossils being chiefly derived. Some of the layers contain comminuted shells with single waterworn valves of Ostrea conica, etc. I have upon two or three occasions discovered a large Nautilus in the upper beds of this series of deposits, the chambers of which were filled with a dark blue chalcedony. This division contains the following fossils Spicula of sponge, with spongoid bodies Fossil coniferous wood Pecten quinquecostatus Exogyra (Ostrea) conica Ammonites inflatus Nautilus Teeth of Otodus and Lamna Fourth Division (Chloritic Marl, etc.) Deposited upon a seam of irregular-bedded Rag, being the topmost layer of the chert beds, is a layer of laminated pea-green sand, about one foot four inches thick, which indicates an almost sudden change in the deposits. A thin seam of comminuted shells runs through this, with numerous entire single valves of Pecten orbicularis, and Pecten quinquecostatus.
