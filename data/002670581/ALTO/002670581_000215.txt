hempstead series. 157 In thus briefly sketching out the interesting points in the Geology of the Isle of Wight as regards the Tertiaries, it is beyond the province of this book to repeat the detailed sections, so indispensable to the worker. The " Memoirs of the Geological Survey," from which I have largely drawn, are full of the most minute and exact details as to particular beds, which in actual field work are found invaluable. To preserve fossils collected near the coast from any of these Tertiary beds, it is necessary to immerse them in fresh water until the salt is extracted from them ; without this precaution they are liable to decay and crumble to pieces. The Chalk Marl fossils are liable to suffer in the same way. The following extract from Professor Geikie's " Text Book of Geology," 1882, p. 837, will assist the reader in forming some idea of the life and climate of the time : â€” " The climate of the Tertiary periods underwent in the northern hemisphere a remarkable change. At the beginning it was of a subtropical character, even in the centre of Europe and North America. It then gradually became more temperate, but flowering plants and shrubs continued to live even far within the Arctic circle, where, then as now, there must have been six sunless months every year. Growing still milder the climate passed eventually into a phase of extreme cold, when snow and ice extended from the Arctic regions into the centre of Europe and North America. Since that time the cold has again diminished, until the present thermal distribution has been reached. With such changes of geography and of climate the life of Tertiary time, as might have been anticipated, is found to have been remarkably varied.
