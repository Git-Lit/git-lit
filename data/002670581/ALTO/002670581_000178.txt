126 TERTIARY SERIES. parts of Hampshire, on the east as well as on the west, from which it has been separated by the depression caused by the folding of the beds and their subsequent denudation. London Clay. This next highest member of the series also extends from east to west, and from its inclined, almost vertical position, has an outcrop scarcely wider than its thick ness. At Alum Bay it has a depth of upward of 200ft., and consists of alternating clays, sands, and ironstones, with septaria. In the lower portion is a bed of dark clay, containing a zone of Pholadomya margaritacea, the shells exhibiting a pearly nacre when in good preserva tion. During my first visit to Alum Bay, while working these beds, I was fortunate in finding a small crab. The junction between the Plastic and London Clays is well defined in White Cliff Bay by red mottled clays, and still more clearly by a bed composed of rounded flint pebbles, similar to those found in Sandown Bay, but on a much smaller scale, being only 2 to 3 inches thick. This bed is more conspicuous in White Cliff than at Alum Bay. It is the " Basement Bed " of Professor Prestwich, and is well described by him in the following passage : â€” " In the fine section at Alum Bay there may be seen, at a distance of 94 feet from the Chalk, a thin and insignificant layer, not a foot thick, of rather large (egg-sized) rounded black flint pebbles imbedded in a scanty yellow sand and brown clay, and separating the important mass of the London Clay on the one side from that of the mottled clays on the other and to the former of which it forms the base.
