THE SOUTHERN DOWNS. 93 Calbourne, and Brook. Across these valleys com munication between the North and South division of the Island is carried on. The range runs with a smooth and undulating outline almost straight from Bembridge Down to St. George's Down, south-east of Newport, where it terminates suddenly with a bold face at the valley of the Medina. The other side of the valley the range takes a southerly direction, and losing its simple outline forms a double, or in some places a triple line. This occurs between Gatcomb and Brixton, at which latter place it again unites and resumes its direct westerly course ; broken by the Chine at Freshwater Gate, it ends in the bold head land which forms the magnificent cliffs of Scratchells and the Needles. The greatest height attained by any part of the (Northern) range is at Mottistone Down, where it rises to a height of 66 1 feet above the level of the sea. The Southern Downs.
