96 chalk formation. The upper bed is from four to six inches thick. These beds I propose to name the Ammonites falcatus zones, as this fossil is peculiar to the beds. Ammonites Falcatus. It appears from the lithological character of these two beds that an almost sudden change took place, and instead of the mixed calcareous matter described, we are at once introduced to the Chalk Marl proper. Here the Scaphite of the Chalk Marl first makes its appearance, associated with such characteristic fossils as Ammonites Mantelli, A. varians, Turrelites tuberculatus. From the basement bed, or Fossiliferous Marl, up to the zones of Ammonites Rhotomagensis, the distance is approximately between forty and fifty feet, probably more than less. But, as has been stated, no exact measurement of these deposits can as yet be taken. The lowermost beds are exposed in detached portions in a small Bay below Devonshire Terrace, at Ventnor, where they remain tilted up in the position in which they fell during the great landslip which caused the formation
