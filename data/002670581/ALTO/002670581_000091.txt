65 BLACKGANG CHINE. part of this rude hollow, whose flanks are in a state of continual decay. They are mostly composed of very dark blue clay, through which, at intervals, run horizontal strata of bright yellow sandstone, about twelve or fifteen feet thick, which naturally divide into square blocks, and have exactly the appearance of vast courses of masonry, built at different heights, to sustain the mouldering hill. " What has been hitherto described may be called the upper part of the Chine, for on descending to the sea shore we find that the stratum of ironstone already mentioned forms a cornice, from whose edge the rill falls perpendicularly seventy-four feet. As the sub stratum is of a softer material than the ironstone, being a blue-black indurated clay, the action of the fall has worn it into a hollow, shining with a dusky polish, from damp, and stained with the deep green of aquatic lichens, or the ferruginous tint of Chalybeate exudations. The silver thread of water which falls through the air in front of this singular cove is, when the wind blows fresh, twisted into most fantastic and waving curves, and not seldom caught by the eddy, and carried up unbroken to a height greater than that from which it fell, and at last is dissipated in mist- When a S.W. wind creates a heavy swell on the shore the echo of the sound of the waves in this gloomy recess is truly astonishing, and has exactly the effect of a deep subterraneous roar issuing from the bottom of the cave. When sudden heavy rains, or the melting of snows, increase the quantity of water in the fall the scenery of this spot must be more striking than most in England."* * Sir Henry Englefield, 1810-11. E
