106 CHALK FORMATION. Passing along towards Freshwater, Sir Henry Englefield, writing in 1811 of the cliffs, thus speaks of them :â€” ' West of where the [old] lighthouse stood, the cape shoots out almost to a point, and to those whose nerves are proof against the horrors of the position, the views into the bays beneath, and of the cliffs, is extremely sublime. In hard blowing weather the fury of the wind on this promontory is scarcely credible. Very large flints and fragments of chalk are blown from the cliffs, so as to endanger the windows of the lighthouse, and for many days in succession it is scarcely possible to open the door."* "The flints in the chalk are, for the most part, irregular in shape, but sometimes they constitute tabular layers coincident with the stratification, or else filling cracks and joints The former are derived from silicious matter, frequently, and perhaps m most instances, deposited contemporaneously with the calcareous sediment of which the chalk is com- posed, around sponges and other organised bodies. The latter, on the contrary, are of more recent origin, having been carried by percolating water holding silica in solution, into cracks and joints formed in the chalk during or after its solidification. The tabular bands of flint filling cracks and joints are therefore, as might be expected on the last supposition, unfossiliferous, in stead of abounding in fossils, as is the case with the other system of flints.
