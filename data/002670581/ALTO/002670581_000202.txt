146 TERTIARY SERIES. recompensed my toil in rearing them, as well by their beauty as their fragrance." Continuing my walk amidst the blocks of Limestone and Sandstone, I found that the shore terminated abruptly in a point which formed one of the arms of Priory Bay, at the northern extremity of which was a landing place. " A fault at the Point, running in a direction 300 E. of S., skirts the shore and brings up the Nettlestone division of the Osborne beds, in a manner that at first sight appears to be very puzzling."* These beds may possibly, if belonging to the Osborne series, have fallen from their proper position on to the shore below. The clays forming the slope beneath the wood a quarter of a mile south of Nettlestone Point are almost black, and contain some fossiliferous bands, consisting chiefly of half valves of Cyrena semi-striata, Cyrena iransversa, Melanopsis, Melania, Paludina lenta, etc. Large quantities fall out of the cliff", and strew the ground beneath. A band of sandy clay near the top of the cliff contains Cerithium and other shells. They are of a reddish brown colour, and when first seen they appear to be in perfect condition, but owing to the clay being much laminated and permeated by water, it is difficult to keep them so when extracted. These beds and their fossils, though small in extent, are really of great interest to the collector. Nothing more is seen of the Osborne series between Watchhouse Point and Whitecliff Bay, where, in the summer of 1856, about 80 feet of these beds were â€¢ Mem. Geol.
