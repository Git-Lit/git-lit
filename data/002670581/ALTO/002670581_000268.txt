210 THE HUMAN PERIOD. existence man was scarcely distinguishable from the brute. The desire to supply his wants absorbed all his efforts, tended to one single aim, to obtain his daily food. All evidence tends to prove the original barbarous state of mankind; but the civilised man, like an upstart in the pride of his matured intellect, in the pride of his acquired position, ignores his base and low origin. Man, in the earliest stage of his development, like the helpless infant, was equally naked both as to body and mind, and like other animals was without speech, without experience of the past, and without knowledge of the future." We have traced the geological history of the Isle of Wight, from its earliest recorded period to the time when, as we have seen, it was first inhabited by man, and with our feet trespassing upon historic grounds, which is the domain of the arch√¶ologist rather than the geologist, bring this volume to a close.
