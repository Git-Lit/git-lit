APPENDIX. 217 chalk at Handfast Point with that of Alum Bay, and on passing the Point a like similarity of strata was apparent between that of Swanage Bay and Sandown Bay. The order of succession is precisely the same, and ranges from the Chalk to the Weald Clay. The Purbeck beds extend below Durlston Bay, and passing round to the west still lower strata are exposed. With the exception of the Hastings sands of Swanage Bay, to which series a portion of the Wealden beds of the Isle of Wight may perhaps be referred, there is no equivalent in the Isle of Wight to these latter strata. With regard to the Tertiaries of the Purbeck district they are, in many respects, identical with those of the Isle of Wight, the most remarkable being the pipe-day beds of the Bagshot series, with their fossil leaves ; they are to be found at Corse as at Bournemouth. In 1855 Dr. Bowerbank and Mr. Prestwich placed about 300 specimens at the disposal of the officers of the Geological Survey, which resulted in the recogni tion of 50 well characterised species, most of them referable to living genera. Out of 22 species found at Bournemouth, 13 are identical with those of Alum Bay, and after comparison witi tropical and sub tropical flora, the conclusion arrived at was that at that period the Isle of Wight enjoyed a climate com parable to Southern Europe at the present day. Those specially interested in the fossil botany of these deposits cannot do better than study the beautiful plates now being figured and descibed by Mr. Starkie Gardner, in the volumes of the P. l√¶ontographical Society. That the Isle of Wig ht has been separated from the mainland in comparativ ;ly recent times is evident from the occurrence of the r mains of elephants, etc., in the
