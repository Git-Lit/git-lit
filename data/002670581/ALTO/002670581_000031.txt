ITS LAND AND CLIMATE. 17 that the animals and terrestrial plants of the Wealden lived and died near the area where their relics are entombed ; for, with the exception of the shells and crustaceans, and certain marsh and aquatic plants, all the fossil remains bear unequivocal marks of having been transported from a great distance. But though three-fourths of the bones discovered have evidently been broken and rolled before their deposition, the teeth detached from their sockets, the vertebræ, and the bones of the extremities, with but very few excep tions, disjointed and scattered here and there, the stems and branches of the trees torn to pieces and stripped of their foliage — there is no intermixture of sea-shells, nor of beach or shingle : these remains have been subjected to abrasion from river currents, but not to attrition from the waves of the ocean. " The gigantic limbs of the large saurians could not have been dissevered from their sockets without great violence, except by the decomposition of their tendons from long maceration in water ; and if the latter were alone the cause of the dislocation of the bones, we should not find them broken and waterworn, but lying more or less in juxtaposition, as is the case in the skeletons of the marine reptiles of the liassic deposits. But the condition in which the fossil relics of the Wealden occur, proves that they were floated down the streams and rivers, with rafts of trees and other spoils of the land, till, arrested in their course, they sank down and became buried in the fluviatile sediments then in progress. " The state of the first discovered specimen of the Hylaosaurus is in this point of view highly instructive : many of the bones are crushed and splintered, yet B
