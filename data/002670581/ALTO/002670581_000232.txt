RED BEACH. 174 The Bay below Lord Dysart's (Steephill Cove) is now choked up by a bank of rounded flint pebbles, called shingles ; but I was informed that twenty years ago it was covered with a beautiful sand like Sandown Bay. These shingles consist of rounded silicious fragments, of a great variety of colours, and about the size of beans Fifty years ago there were none east of Rockenend, but they have now covered the whole of the shore between that place and Bonchurch, and they extend from Rockenend to Freshwater. It would seem they are carried east by the tides, which are said to be more rapid here than formerly, owing probably -to the wearing away of many points of land and rocks that projected into the sea, and which defended the creeks along the shore."* It is said by the old fishermen that the barrier reef at Rockenend was swept away at high tide during the prevalence of a great gale (.possibly that of 1825) ; whether it was so or not, according to the testimony of Mr. Webster, the red shingle has undoubtedly escaped past Rockenend since the beginning of the present century. I am tempted to think that it is more likely derived from the masses of submerged Upper Chalk strata which, disappearing at the Needles, crops up in Swanage Bay, and in the island of Purbeck on the Dorsetshire coast, a distance of about 15 miles across the channel. The white chalk with flints much disturbed by upheaval, and the flints at both places being much shattered, they would easily be washed out of the submerged strata, the fractures causing the fragments to separate, after which they would be subjected to attrition. The tidal currents would carry Â« Webster to Englefield, 1810.
