Turtles of various kinds must have been seen on the banks and in the waters of its rivers and lakes, and groups of enormous crocodiles basking in its fens and marshes. The colossal Megalosaurus and Pelorosaurus, and yet more marvellous Iguanodon, to whom the groves of clathrariæ and arborescent ferns would be mere beds of reeds, must have been of such prodigious magnitude, that the existing animal creation presents us with no fit objects of comparison.
