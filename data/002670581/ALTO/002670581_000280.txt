ADDENDUM. 222 remains having been found in recent years at Maidstone, in Kent. The Dinosaurian reptiles, of which I shall now speak, attained in this period a size and importance not reached before, and which appears to have dwindled away almost immediately after. Foremost, and best known of these great beasts, is the Iguanodon, which probably attained a length of sixty feet, and whose remains have been found in great abundance in the whole Wealden area. Unfortunately in the English deposits we have only found single, or at most a few bones in one spot ; but at Bernissart, in Belgium, many complete skeletons were discovered a few years ago, and are now to be seen in the Brussels museum, where they have been restored and built up again by M. Dollo. The remains of the Hylæosaurus, Megalosaurus (great lizard), and the Hypsilophodon, show us that their possessors must have been almost as large, if not larger than the Iguanodon. Mantell points out in his " Petrifactions " (also in " Wonders of Geology ") how the remains of these great creatures got rolled and broken, and goes on to explain that their position proves that they were floated down the river, buoyed up by the gas generated by their decomposition, and associated with trunks and leaves of trees, and other remains. They would probably lose the limbs one by one, and finally the carcase would be arrested in its course and be buried in the accumulating sediment. He also points out that in the case of the first dis covered specimen of the Hylæosaurus (forest lizard), while many of the bones were crushed and broken, yet the pieces remained close together, and relative to the position they occupied during life. The glenoid cavities were filled with stone, proving that the forelegs were
