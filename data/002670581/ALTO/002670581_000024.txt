WEALDEN FORMATION, 10 vitation were issued as follows (I relate this to give an idea of the supposed capacity of some of these animals, based on comparative anatomy) : — ' Mr. Hawkins solicits the honour of Professor 's company to a dinner in the Iguanodon, on the 31st December, 1853, at four p.m.' This novel request was written on the wing of a Pterodactyle,* spread before a most graphic etching of the Iguano don, with its socially loaded stomach so practically and easily filled as to tempt all who possibly could do so to accept this singular invitation. There were twenty-one guests around Mr. Hawkins in the body of the Iguanodon, before the upper part of the back and head were completed. In the chair most appropriately sat Professor Owen, who occupied part of the head of this gigantic animal. He was supported by the late Professor Forbes, Mr. Prestwich, the eminent geologist, Mr. Gould, the celebrated ornithologist, with other eminent men. This model represents the natural size of the animal during life, at a palace, where they are not obliged to be content with its pictures or dry bones.' "+ Dr. Mantell's estimate of the length of the Iguanodon was from sixty to seventy feet ; that of other writers, less : the difference in computation depending on the length of the tail. The bones composing the vertebral column are the most numerous remains of the skeleton occuring in the Wealden deposits ; but, unfortunately, the structure of the neural arch and of its processes renders the characteristic parts so liable to injury, •A species of flying lizard; an extinct genus of Saurians.
