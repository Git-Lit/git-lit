94 CHALK FORMATION. Towards the land the outline of this range is irregular, being of various breadths ; whilst its face towards the sea is nearly straight, and bounded by the edge of the great wall of the Undercliff. Immediately east of St. Catherine's the range is narrow, but at St. Lawrence a branch runs inland three miles, to the various parts of which the names of Week, Stenbury, and Appuldur combe Downs have been given. Littletown, Wroxall, and St. Boniface Downs are very irregular. The two latter show several heads of coombs, which, no doubt, before the fall of the Undercliff, extended as transverse valleys some distance southwards. St. Boniface Down and Littletown Down join that of St. Martin's on the east, and extend westward in a winding direction, from above Shanklin to Cook's Castle, where the whole terminates in a rounded spur, crowned with foliage, from which a gentle descent down a narrow* lane leads to the village of Wroxall. These Eastern Downs, as well as those on the West, are everywhere composed at their base of the Chalk Marl, which runs around them in what may be termed " a fillet," about 60 feet thick, and passes upwards into the Grey Chalk (which is much used in this locality for lime-burning). The characteristic fossils are chiefly found in the lower portions of the deposit. Owing to the difficulty of dividing the Chalk Marl from the Grey Chalk, on account of the distribution of the fossils, only approximate measurements can be obtained of these two deposits. These measurements are only possible in the few pits that have been opened, but none of these extend to more than 12 to 70 feet vertically, and most of the fossiliferous zones are obscured by debris.
