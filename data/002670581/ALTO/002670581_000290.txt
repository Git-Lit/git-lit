232 ADDENDUM. periods of incalculable antiquity and duration, and whose races are now extinct, is based that most interesting department of natural history which has recently acquired the rank of a distinct branch of modern science, under the title of Pal√¶ontology. " As the remains of animals and plants imbedded in the earth are found in different states of preservation and more or less altered in appearance and composition by mineralization, the epithets figured stones, petrifactions, fossils, organic remains, etc., are commonly employed to denote the various conditions in which such relics occur. To avoid confusion it is, therefore, necessary to define the sense in which these terms are used in the following pages ; especially as the words ' petri factions,' and ' fossils,' are very generally regarded as synonymous. " And here we must premise that the state of preservation of an organic body, and the chemical changes which it may have undergone in the mineral kingdom, have no necessary relation to its antiquity ; for in comparatively modern deposits fossil remains of animals and plants often have acquired a stony hardness, while in rocks of the most ancient epochs they are sometimes as little changed as if they had been entombed in the strata but a few centuries. " 1. Fossils, may be defined as the durable parts of animal and vegetable structures imbedded in rocks and strata by natural causes at a remote period ; thus wood in the state of lignite, bog-wood, and coal, or of silicious or calcareous stone, is fossil wood; and bones or shells, whether in an earthy and decaying state, or permeated by calc-spar, flint, or iron, and converted into a hard mineral substance; are alike fossil bones or shells.
