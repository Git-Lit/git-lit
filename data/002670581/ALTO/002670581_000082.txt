58 THE LOWER GREENSAND. The whole ending with the white chalk cliffs of Freshwater, which, on a clear day, when the colours of the sea and sky are blended on the distant horizon, and the red and white cliffs are lighted up by the sun, is a scene which deeply impresses the memory of those who admire coast and inland scenery combined. Indication of Conditions under which these Beds were Deposited. " It appears that ' at the close of the Wealden there was a sudden depression of the bed of the great fresh water estuary, and an influx of the sea. The first effect of such an influx would be the destruction of the animals in the estuary not adapted for living in salt water ; hence we find a total destruction of the Wealden animals, the remains of which accumulate towards the point of the junction of that formation with the Lower Greensand â€” a fact which indicates the nature of the change. Even the Cerithium, although belonging to a genus, many species of which are capable of living in the depths of the sea, was destroyed, notwithstanding that its appearance only in the uppermost beds of the Wealden indicates that its presence there was due to the commencement of the very state of things which eventually destroyed it. That the depression was of some extent, though not, perhaps, of verv many fathoms is indicated by the nature of the animals which lived in the first-formed sea-bed, and which, when they died, were often embedded in the fine and probably fast-depositing mud in the vertical position in which
