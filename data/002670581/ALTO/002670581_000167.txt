Notes on the Clay with Flints and the Flints found in this deposit. The flints of the Island all come from the denuda tion of the Upper White Chalk. At present I purpose to treat only of those which occur in the beds on the Downs above Ventnor, and along the shore as far as Bonchurch, Luccombe and Shanklin, and their relation to the Upper White Chalk. Sir Henry Englefield was the first to call attention to the shattered condition of the Flints of the Island, and which I have referred to in my description of the Chalk.
