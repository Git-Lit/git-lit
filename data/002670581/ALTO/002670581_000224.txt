166 TERTIARY series. and rabbit have been found, together with teeth of other animals, and numerous land shells. This bed is also found resting upon and following the slope of the Down above it, having been cut through during the excavations made for building the north end of the Railway Station. On the western side of Milanese Villa, which stands at the west end of Mill Bay, the low sea-cliff is capped by a stratum of partially-rounded chalk debris, and small angular flints ; it is from 8 to 10 feet thick, is stratified, and is probably the result of the wasting energy of the rains. It re-appears at intervals on the tops of the low cliffs between Ventnor and Niton. Loams and red flint-gravels, which, from the similarity of their fossil contents and other points, are doubtless contemporaneous with the existing order of things, are found here ; they fill a fissure in the cliff above Old Park, and occur also between Puckaster and Rocken End. Another thick bed occurs above the Railway Tunnel, at Ventnor ; it is found extending to some distance, on the eastern side of the cutting, resting upon the Upper Greensand. A black peaty deposit sometimes occurs in these superficial beds of undoubted vegetable origin. A human thigh bone, found by myself, and the upper portion of a skull of a young elephant (E. primogemus) found by some workmen, fix the age of these deposits as that of the Human Period. The wasting action of the atmosphere, which attacks and crumbles into soil the rocks of the surface, has probably been their origin ; for from their elevated position (300 to 400 feet above sea level) it is difficult to consider them the work of rivers.
