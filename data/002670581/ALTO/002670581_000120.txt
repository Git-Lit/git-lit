84 THE UPPER GREENSAND. Whitwell, which some have designated as a fault. The gap has been caused by the strata composing the mass of the cliff parting at one of the fissures, and by a depression at that spot ; this is at once visible, as the top part of the cliff can be seen, w*ith the fossiliferous marl resting on it, a short distance up, on both sides of the shute. The strata conform to each other some thirty or forty feet below their proper position, and a considerable distance below the line of cliff. The road is stated to have been made by one of the Worsley family cutting through the rocky barrier, it having been a mere pass. The road has been lowered at various periods in consequence of accidents, — some fatal, as the neighbouring churchyard testifies. The view of Steephill Castle from the gate of the little churchyard is one to be admired : with the spires of the two Churches at Ventnor rising above the foliage which surrounds the Castle. Between here and Ventnor the cliffs are much obscured in places by the dense foliage which slopes upward from the road towards them. The trees, shrubs, and vegetation being rooted into the talus which has accumulated at the foot of the cliff, have prevented the disintegration of the soft sandstone beds below, by covering and excluding them from the wear and tear of the elements, so that they remain intact, and are moss grown and trellised with ivy in many places. From Steephill to Ventnor the subsidence of the strata, which have been detached from the parent cliff in larger masses than can be observed elsewhere, is not so abrupt — if we except Eastend ; along the line of disturbance, some having descended in an almost
