190 DENUDATION AND LANDSLIPS. a continual source of destruction to the land ; they slowly but surely excavate it, running towards the sea and forming deep chasms, or, as they are called here, " Chines." This is especially the case along the south coast. The process, still in activity, may be seen to most advantage between Rocken End and Compton Bay; Blackgang, Walpen, Whale, Ladder, Cowleaze and Brook Chines offering the best examples. I have dwelt at some length upon surface-water as a land-destroying agent, for its importance cannot be over-estimated. The Undercliff shows us a disinte gration of strata for a distance of seven miles in an almost direct line, and one can find in this tract a very perfect series of examples of denudation. This spot so greatly celebrated for the quiet charm of its beauty, is described by Sir James Clarke, in his work upon " Climate," as "A lofty natural terrace, backed by a mountainous wall on the north, and open on the south to the full influence of the sun, from his rising to his going down, during that season when his influence is most wanted in a northern country. The climate is remarkably equable, as well as mild and dry, and there are few days during the winter months on which the invalid cannot take some exercise in the open air. The mildness and dryness of the climate during the winter months may in some degree be estimated by the circumstance of myrtles, geraniums, and various tender greenhouse plants, usually withstanding the winter in the open flower gardens. The absorption of the heat by the almost perpendicular cliffs of the Undercliff, exposed as they are to the rays of the sun during the whole day, must be considerable, even in winter, and the radiation of this heat during the night
