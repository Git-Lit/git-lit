bembridge marls. 153 former the green clays and stony bands yield Paludina lenta, Melania turritissima, M. muricata, Melanopsis carinata, and Cyrena obovata. The Oyster Bed already referred to appears at St. Helen's, near the old Church. The same series of strata are repeated near Foreland Point, having a thickness of about 9ft., with almost similar fossil contents. " Below Hempstead Cliff" is " the only place in the Island where these strata are displayed throughout their entire thickness. In that locality the whole of the beds which compose this subdivision, from the Bembridge Limestone forming Hempstead Ledge to ' Black Band ' which constitutes the base of the Hempstead series, may be examined in detail at low water, without a break, as they successively crop out on the shore, and their beautifully preserved fossils be collected."* There is an exposure at St. Helen's, close to the Old Tower, and above the Limestone already described. At this spot Professor Forbes mentions the finding of an Area and a Modiola " in the brown clay above the Oyster band." The following list of some of the characteristic fossils of the Bembridge series is taken from the work by Mr. Bristow : — Cytherea incrassata Achatina costellata Bulimus ellipticus Limnæa longiscata Helix, 8 species Melania, 3 sp. Melanopsis, 4 sp. Paludina, 3 sp. Planorbis, 6 sp. Cerithium, 2 sp. • Mem. Geol. Burr., Bristow, Isle of Wight, 1862, p. 82.
