BARTON CLAY. 135 " The variety of the vertical layers are endless, and may be likened to the vivid stripes of a parti-coloured tulip." These sands were formerly a source of employment and profit ; glass bottles were filled with them, and by an ingenious arrangement of the different colours views of the neighbourhood, and local subjects of interest, such as the Headstone of Little Jane's Grave, Freshwater Rocks, and the Cottage of the Dairyman's Daughter were represented, and sometimes sand pictures on cardboard were executed in no mean way. The demand for these ornaments, however, has much decreased in recent years. Barton Clay. So named from the cliffs at Barton on the opposite coast of Hampshire, which contain a large series of fossils, of which some are found in the beds exposed in Alum and Whitecliff Bays. This series has a world wide celebrity, both for the number of its fossils and their fine preservation. " These beds are here represented by clays in the lower part overlying the pebble-bed already referred to as being seen in Alum and Whitecliff Bays. The nature of these deposits (which are composed of sandy clays, and sands with layers of Septaria) is suffi ciently shown in the measured sections of Alum Bay, in which locality they attain a thickness of 300 feet. There, also, they are rich in fossil remains, the whole of which are of marine origin."* * Mem. Geol. Survey, Bristow, Isle of Wight, 1862, p. 46.
