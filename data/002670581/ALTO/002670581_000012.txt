VI It has long been my wish to see Geology, with other branches of natural science, adopted in the schools of this country, and recognised as an essential part of education, as I am convinced that there is no truer basis for the interest and advancement of life than an earnest study of nature and her rich storehouses. MARK W. NORMAN. Ventnor, 1887.
