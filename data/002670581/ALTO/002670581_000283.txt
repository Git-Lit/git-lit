The Museum is open from 11 to 4 daily (Sundays excepted), and is accessible to the public free of charge. Those, however, who have the means, are expected to give some little pecuniary aid, for the reception of which a box is placed within the room near the entrance. The present curators are : Mr. John Wood, Dr. Groves, and Mr. John Young. The contents of the Museum are very varied : amongst the numerous objects of interest in the geological department is a collection of bones of the gigantic Saurian reptiles of the Wealden of the Island, several of which may be said to rival those from the same formation in the collection of the British Museum. The other formations, ranging from the Lower Green sand to the Tertiaries, are all represented by their fossils, which have been arranged, classified, and named by Mr. Keeping, of the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge. In the Arch√¶ological department are collections of ancient and Roman pottery, flint imple ments and arrow heads, with bones and teeth of animals, the most prominent among them being the teeth of the Mammoth (Elephas Primigenius).
