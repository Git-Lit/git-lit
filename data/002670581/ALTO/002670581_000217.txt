LATER TERTIARY DATE. 159 grounds, and therefore, by way of distinction, called " high-level gravel " ; and secondly, deposits of a more recent age than the former, to which the term " low level gravel " may, in many cases, be applied with propriety. The high-level (or older) gravel was deposited after the elevation and denudation of the Chalk, while the low-level gravel was formed in great part from the waste of the older gravel, when the brick-earth and other deposits of later date were thrown down in the combes, and in the slopes of the lower ground. The thin covering of angular chalk flints upon the higher portions of the chalk-range, as Beacon and Afton Downs, at the western extremity of the Island, is said by Mr. Godwin Austen, at page 2 of Professor Forbes' Memoir, to be ' the residue of that portion of chalk which has been dissolved away,' and the Downs are stated to furnish ' good illustrations of the rate of waste over calcareous surfaces from the action of rain water alone."* I presume that during a period of slow but continual upheaval of the land, a river cut its way through the mass of the " clay with flints," flowing in two directions, one eastward near Bembridge, the other westward, emptying itself into the sea near Freshwater, and depositing this gravel, the waste of the " clay with flints," on its banks to such an extent, as in some places to form low cliffs. The rounded and water worn nature of a large number of the flints would seem to corroborate my view. Many of them have been subjected to so much attrition as to resemble the pebbles of a sea shore. â€¢ Mem. Geol. Surv., Bristow, Isle of Wight, 1862, p. 43.
