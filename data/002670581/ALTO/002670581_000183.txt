MIDDLE BAGSHOT SERIES. 131 Some leaves collected from these beds may be seen in the collection at the Literary Institute, at Ventnor ; but they are, as a rule, much deranged, and render description difficult. The Middle Bagshot beds in Whitecliff Bay correspond with those in Alum Bay. In February, 1873, during the prevalence of long-continued north-west winds, the floor of the former became totally denuded of its sand, and the ridges of harder strata extending seawards to low water mark, were in consequence laid bare. Amongst them, con spicuous by its blackness, was the lignite bed of the Bagshot series. The discovery, on being made known, created the utmost excitement amongst the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns and villages, and the little Ba}', ordinarily so quiet, was crowded with sightseers. So great was the excitement that one might have imagined the discovery of a second California. My statement, much doubted at the time by those who consulted me, that in spite of its strong resemblance to coal it was unlike the true coal of the carboniferous formation were proved by subsequent trial to be correct; and its comparative worthlessness as fuel, put the matter beyond dispute. Further research showed it to belong to the Bracklesham series, and to be the same lignite bed as occurs in Alum Bay. The seam of lignite was about 4ft. thick ; its vertical position prevented its extent from being known. Excavations were carried on with great vigour, until forbidden by the lord of the manor and the authorities at the Admiralty. Keen disappointment was experienced by the villagers and fishermen when they found that the " coal " was useless unless mixed with the true coal. Without the latter it only smouldered, or as house-
