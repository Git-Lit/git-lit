st. Catherine's down. 169 along the base of the low cliffs on the shore between Watershute and Rocken End, and a bed of silt, con taining twigs and leaves of trees, was cut through in digging the foundations for St. Catherine's Lighthouse. At Binnel, near Old Park, trunks of trees have been sometimes exposed by the action of the sea, but are mostly hidden by the shingle and debris which are heaped at the base of the cliff. In digging the foun dations of the houses between Steephill and Ventnor, trunks of trees, embedded in a muddy silt intermixed with smooth, surface-worn boulders, were found, together with vegetable remains, and bones and teeth of the animals. The same stratum was traced beneath the houses in Ventnor during the process of well-boring and excavating for cellars. In some places the vegetable remains are from two to three feet in thickness. In a well-boring twelve or fourteen feet below the surface of the lower part of the High Street, large bones of animals, with trunks and branches of trees were found. These trees were stated to be Birch, Willow, Hazel, Alder and Ash. They re-appear in another well-boring at Aratrum Villa, with the addition of an abundance of hazel-nuts and brambles. The presence of water-worn boulders, associated with the peaty mass lying beneath the silt, and forming a sort of bog, suggests the idea of occasional floods being the agent which, destroying the animal and vegetable life of some old world land surface, carried them off and deposited them in their present resting place. A cluster of springs occur at Ventnor. These formed at one time a stream of sufficient force to drive a mill. No longer put to this use, it forms a waterfall near the Parsonage House, and from thence descends
