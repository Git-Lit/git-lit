118 chalk Formation. In the clays found in the fissures the flints have been splintered in the same manner. The neighbour hood of Ventnor is peculiarly rich in deposits of Flints, more particularly along that part of the shore w-hich extends from the Gas House east of Ventnor, and beyond Bonchurch as far as Luccombe and Shanklin. Between the latter place and Ventnor a sea-cliff runs, consisting of strata in situ. Some portions of it are about 200ft. high (those from Shanklin), and are composed of the Lower Greensand until Bonchurch is reached, westward of which they consist of unstrati fied masses of the debris of the strata which has fallen from above, and in which chalk, flints, and portions of the different strata are confusedly intermixed. Its origin was a landslip which occurred during the formation of the Undercliff, to be described hereafter. Here a great portion of the debris consists of black flints embedded in either a tenacious red clay, or a white, or whitish-grey clay, the latter resembling the pipe-clay, or leaf-bed of the Lower Bagshot series of Alum Bay. These two clay beds, the result of the extensive denudation of the Chalk and Tertiary beds in past ages, form in places the entire face of the cliff ; but the sea, attacking the base, undermines it, and causes large masses of the flints to become loosened, and to fall on the shore. A talus, or slope, is thus formed, which in its turn -is attacked by the sea, and the clay is washed away, leaving the flints behind. The flints thus washed out from the clay are scattered along the shore, and drift eastward, forming a line which extends beyond Shanklin to Sandown. Besides many species of sponges, the flints here, as elsewhere, contain Cidaris, Galeritcs, Terebratula, and many forms
