TERTIARY SERIES. 150 End, nearly to Totlands Bay. As is usually the case, it varies greatly both in character and composition. As a general rule the Bembridge Limestone may be distinguished from the thick Upper Headon Limestones, as well as from those in the lower beds, by its greater whiteness and by its peculiar brecciated or tufaceous character, as well as by the fossils either being casts, or having their shells replaced by cale spar ; the Headon Limestones, on the contrary, being of a somewhat darker cream colour, more earthy and soft in composition, and having the shells of the limnæa and other fossils preserved. The total thick ness of these beds at Headon Hill is from fifteen to sixteen feet."* The band containing the characteristic fossils, Bulimus ellipticus, Helix globosis, Planorbis and others, furnishes better and more numerous specimens at Sconce than at any other locality. There are several quarries at Headon Hill from which fossils can be obtained, as well as from the fallen blocks lying on the shore. In some of the more white and chalky portions of these beds Bulimus ellipticus occurs with the shell entire ; but whatever their con dition, in point of size and numbers they far excel those found at Binstead and other localities. Possibly this may be accounted for by the supposition that when living the animals enjoyed more favourable conditions in this locality. Woodward, in his " Manual of the Mollusca," in speaking of the Bulimus says, "-Bulimus ovatus attains a length of six inches, and is sold in the market of Rio " ifor food). » M«m. Geol.
