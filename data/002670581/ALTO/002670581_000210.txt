152 TERTIARY SERIES. Road leading from Ryde to Wootton Bridge, excava tions have been carried on to such an extent that the ground is literally honeycombed. These excavations vary in depth from 10 to 20 feet, and appear to have been worked without any particular method. They are known as the " Binstead Pits," and the stone quarried from them as the " Binstead Limestone." There is no doubt that the pits have been worked for centuries, and the stone widely exported. " The Binstead Limestone was formerly highly esteemed as a building stone, and has been used in the construction of several churches in Sussex, the interior of Winchester Cathedral, Lewes Priory, also Yarmouth Castle and Quarr Abbey (I.W.), an old Saxon ruin at Southampton, noticed by Webster, etc."* I have also seen an inkstand made from this stone ; it was dug up from beneath the ruins of Quarr Abbey, and was doubtless the work of one of the old monks. These quarries yield the usual numerous fossils, and are especially noted as containing the teeth of mammalia, Palœotherium, Chæropotamis, Dichobunc, and Anoplotherium, claws of Lobster (probably freshwater), Cray fish, etc. Inland the Bembridge Limestone has been observed at Dodpits, Stony Cross, Shalcombe Down, near Churchill, lane near Brading Church, south of lower Nunwell, etc. Bembridge Marls. These marls are exposed at Thorness Point and in Gurnet Bay ; at the latter place the characteristic fossils are Cyrena, Ostrea and Cerithium mutabile ; at the * Mem. Geol.
