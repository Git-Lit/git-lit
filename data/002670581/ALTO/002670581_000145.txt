THE CHALK MARL. 101 nodular chalk, with veins of a yellow and sometimes a green colour. Above this bed are the lower beds of the Upper Chalk, with small flints, resting upon the two beds of hard grey chalk, which is much used for building purposes in the neighbourhood, as an inspection of the houses and other buildings will show. Between the Upper and Lower Chalk in this pit is a seam of blackish friable rock ; it varies from an inch to two inches in thickness, and appears to consist of vegetable matter. This probably indicates a break in the deposits. Most of the pits at the base of the southern hills have been excavated in the Chalk Marl, and many of them con tain fossils of the usual character. The Chalk Marl and Grey Chalk is also met with along the shores of the Undercliff between Bonchurch and Rockenend, in fallen blocks, amongst the ruins of the strata which have fallen from the cliffs, or is noted where it occupies a position at the edges of the southern hills for the heavy crops of corn raised upon its soil. The following are the characteristic fossils of the Chalk Marl of the Isle of Wight ;— Nautilus elegans „ expansus Turrelites tubercula'-us Ammonites Sussexensis „ Mantelli Terebratula carnea ,, Bergerii „ costatus ,, billicata „ globosa Pholodomya decussata Natica Rostellaria Palatial teeth of Hybodus Teeth of several species of Shark Scaphites œqualis Hamites attenuatus ,, armatus Baculites anceps Ammonites Rhotomagensis Ammonites varians (four varieties) The first thirteen of these are termed the Cephalopoda, and (like the.Nautilus of the present day) are chambered
