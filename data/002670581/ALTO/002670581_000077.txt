BONCHURCH cove. 53 distance from Horse Ledge, a stratum of dark sand occurs, in which concretions of fossils are found, all transformed into hard bright yellow pyrites, the Gervillia anceps being the most prominent, which sometimes are found whole on the beach. Another stratum, about 3 or 4 feet thick, is sometimes laid bare, which contains vegetable remains in a state of lignite. From the Point at Shanklin to Luccombe Chine the strata are divided ; the lower or harder portion being separated from the upper, which has receded to some distance inland, forming a broad terrace by the talus, which has fallen over upon the harder portion, and still keeps receding, until Luccombe Chine is reached ; east of which the cliffs probably attain a height of from 200 to 250 feet. The strata between here and Shanklin is unfossiliferous. I have omitted a description of both Shanklin and Luccombe Chines ; they contain but little of interest to the geologist, except to show the power of small streams of water in excavating these gorges, or "Chines," as they are locally named, as descriptions of them are to be found in all the Guide Books. Between Shanklin and Bonchurch Cove the upper sections of Lower Greensand strata are repeated in the same way as between Blackgang and Rocken End, but with some variations, being less favourably disposed for examination. Between Luccombe and Bonchurch large masses of iron stone strew the shore, but— beyond a few pieces of partially carbonised wood — are unfossiliferous. Large masses of the junction bed and Gault are almost continually falling over the cliff below the Landslip to the shore, but con taining very few organic remains.
