Å’f)t ftrti Beacij. W| 'y-T is well known that the southern shores of if L.K) Isle of Wight are covered to a great depth by a finely-rounded reddish-brown i-^T beach shingle, the pebbles varying in size T from a large bean to a small shot. This deposit is continually drifted by the currents in an easterly direction. It travels fastest when the wind blows from the west, and if a south-west wind springs up, it is driven into the small bays and inlets along the southern coast. It is still partly confined to Chale, Brixton and Brook Bays by a reef of rocks (Rockenend) which stretches from the upper part of the shore for some distance into the sea, the extent of this reef being traceable by the turbulence of the waves, tossing and beating against each other until the sea is white with foam. Composed of the harder portions of the strata, it has so far resisted the denuding forces which removed its upper surfaces, and forms, like Atherfield Ledge, one of the extremities of Chale Bay, the cliffs of which consisting of soft sands and clays have become hollowed out into the form of a half-moon, whilst its base extends in a straight line between the two headlands.
