136 TERTIARY SERIES Many of these fossils in Whitecliff Bay are very friable, probably owing to the loose texture of the soil in which they are embedded. They are found in better preservation in Alum Bay than in Whitecliff Bay, and still more perfect on the Hampshire coast. The beds crop out at Gunville, and at other places in the Island. At Gunville the clay is used for bricks. " The lower part of the Barton Clay is represented in Alum Bay by clays with crushed Turritella, Rostellaria rimosa, Voluta luctatrix, Fusus longavus, and Conus dormitor ; and above, by grey clays containing a hard bed of blue calcareous grit, weathering yellow, with Tellina, Actæon, Corbula Pisum, Pectunculus deletus, Nummulites variolarius, Calyptrœa trochiformis, Typhis pungens, Pecten reconditus, Pkorus agglutinans, Murex asper, Sauguinolaria compressa, Fusus pyrus, Crassatella sulcata, etc."* Upper Bagshot Sands. These sands are reputed to measure from 140 to 208 feet ; the lower 50ft. consisting of a yellow sand, succeeded by 60ft. of white sand. These white sands are remarkable for their purity, which renders them peculiarly suitable for the manufacture of glass. Excavations have been going on for many years, and digging the sands and loading the vessels at one time gave employment to a large number of labourers. A resident writing in 1795 states : " Our trade and commerce chiefly is dealing in corn and wool. There are other commodities, such as ' Copperas stones,' i.e., Pyrites, sulphurate of iron, which are gathered up in heaps on the sea shore, and sent to London for the * Mem. Geol.
