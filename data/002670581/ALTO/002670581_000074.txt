50 the lower greensand. ness of about 200 feet ; the Middle and Lower, 200 feet ; the Upper Greensand, 100 feet ; and the Gault 50 feet. According to this statement the Gault here appears to have lost half its thickness, as compared to other sections in the Island, where it averages over 100 feet. The Perna beds correspond with those of Ather field, and contain similar fossils. The Wealden deposits occupy the middle of the Bay, and on the west the sands and clays of the Lower Greensand reappear, and form the cliffs from Sandown to Shanklin. Sandown Bay comprises, therefore, a double series of deposits of the Cretaceous system, thrown into an anticlinal axis by the elevation of the Wealden, which constitutes the axis of the line of coast. One section of these ferruginous strata forms a very lofty and perpendicular cliff, distinguished by the name of Red Cliff, which bears a striking contrast to those of the neighbouring chalk cliffs. The lower portion of the strata rests upon the Wealden. As at Atherfield and Compton Bay, it consists of two beds, an Upper and Lower. The Lower is much permeated with iron, whilst the Upper is much harder. They are about the same thickness, being about five feet together, and are very fossiliferous, of which the undermen tioned are the most characteristic : — Corbis corrngata Trigonia dædalea ,, alæformis Gryphæ sinuata Lima (spec.)
