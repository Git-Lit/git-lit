ADDENDUM. 221 river, and in the marshes, the Equisetum and plants of a like nature grew and flourished. But it is the animals of this period that more par ticularly excite our wonder and interest. Beginning with the lowest forms, we find in certain shales and clays thousands upon thousands of minute crustaceans, the little bivalved form known as Cypridea. There are many species, and in some localities their remains are so plentiful as to cause the rocks ("paper-shales") in which they are embedded to split up into thin layers, thus giving them the name. Shepherd's Chine, Brixton Bay, and Sandown Bay will yield the collector abundant examples. The mollusca are represented in the Wealden beds by Paludina, Potamides, and other univalves, and among the bivalves are Unio and Cyrena. In many cases these shells exist in great masses, and bear witness to the flooding of the stream with muddy matter, and to the minor disturbances of the great river, which would tend to confine the shells to certain spots, and bury them suddenly. Of the existence of fishes we have abundant proofs, and we also know that they were of large size. Lepidotus has left its traces all through the series, and its lozenge-shaped scales are often met with. Hybodus, with its shark-like teeth and strong spine, also occurs, and must have been a tyrant to the other inhabitants of the waters. Reptiles seem to have found the conditions of life especially favourable ; the waters swarmed with turtles, whilst crocodiles appear to have existed in equal numbers. The Pterodactyle, or flying reptile, survived through the Jurassic period, and passing right through the Wealden, finally died out in the Chalk, some
