120 CHALK FORMATION. Agates," most of which are imported from Germany, and are of artificial manufacture. Amongst the flints which strew the shore are some of a large, conical, or rounded shape. They are very massive, and I once came across a specimen which measured 2ft. iin. in length, and 1st. 3m. in thickness; it was in the form of a flattened cone, and quite smooth on the outside, as are the rest of these peculiar masses. When struck with a hammer they give out a ringing sound like earthenware. Of a light cream colour they appear when broken to be composed of a mixture of white chalk and silex ; irregular cavities ramify through them, and some of them are filled with a whitish powder, gritty to the touch, though it does not soil the fingers_ I was informed by the late Mr. Guyon, who examined it microscopially, that it was rich in Foraminifera. The usual fossils found in these flint nodules are Ananchytes ovatus, Terebratula octopiicata, Inoceramus Cuvieri, spines and tests of Cidaris, &c. I propose to call them "Porcelain Flints"; they doubtless belonged to the Upper White Chalk, as they may yet be seen embedded in the white clay at the base of the cliffs. The presence of chalcedony and quartz in the geodic nodules opens the interesting question of the passage of fluids through flints. It may be presumed that it is possible for a fluid to find its way through flint, the particles being finer than those of the mineral itself. The chalcedony then formed allowed a passage through its interstices to the still purer silicious matter which often formed crystals of quartz. I have several examples of flints so constructed in the collection at the Literary Institute, Ventnor, where they can be inspected by anyone interested. Large nodules of pure chalcedony
