THE SOLENT. 193 as the Isle of Wight, without intercommunication with the main land ; therefore from the co-existence of man and elephants it is clear that the Solent must have been formed within the date of human existence. " The Tertiary strata on the east of the Medina, and those of Stans Ore Point were elevated, or the strata west of the Medina as far as Yarmouth were depressed by two faults, one east and one west in the line of the Solent. These faults must have occurred prior to the great alluvial denudation which shaped the contour of the surface of the Island, for the alluvial forces have obscured the faults themselves on the surface, and subsequent washings have covered by their deposits the Elephant stratum. I allude to these faults because, when they occurred, adjoining strata were raised or depressed, and the questions follow â€” Were the Chalk strata between Freshwater Down and Dorsetshire then broken through ? Was the formation of the Solent then commenced ? Were the lands in the line of the river then depressed, thus facilitating the drainage of the higher lands ? Having started with the undeniable fact that time was when the Solent did not exist, therefore we may conclude that after it commenced to form it was fordable. By the foregoing I have proved it was within the era of the human race (the aborigines ofthe British Islands), therefore there is no reason why the waters of the Solent should not have severed the last land communication with the Island." The above extracts are taken from a paper of a controversial character, respecting the connection of the Island with the tin trade of the Romans. It contains some geological facts from the pen of a local geologist of experience. I have selected those passages N
