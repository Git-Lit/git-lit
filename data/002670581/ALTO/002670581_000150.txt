CHALK FORMATION. 104 In this direction also appears an ancient mansion (Knighton), embellished with woods, groves, and gardens. South-eastward is a broad expanse of ocean bounded only by the horizon. More to the east, in continuation of the chain of hills on which I am sitting (Ashey), rise two Downs ((Brading and Yaver land hills), one beyond the other ; both are covered with sheep, and the sea is just visible over the furthest hill, as a terminating boundary. In this point are seen ships, some of which are sailing, and others lying at anchor. On the north, the sea appears like a noble river (the Solent), varying from three to seven miles in breadth, between the banks of the opposite coast and those of the Island. Immediately underneath me is a fine woody district, diversified by many pleasing objects. Distant towns (Portsmouth and Gosport) are visible on the opposite coast, and numbers of ships occupy the sheltered station which this northern channel affords them. Westward, the hills follow each other, forming several intermediate and partial valleys, in undulations like the waves of the sea, and bending to the south, complete the boundary of the larger valley I have described, to the southward of the hill on which I sit. One hill alone (St. Catherine's), the highest in elevation, and about ten miles to the south westward, is enveloped in a cloud, which just permits a dim and hazy sight of a signal post, a light-house, and an ancient chantry, on its summit."* In Alum Bay, as well as throughout the range of he main mass, the dip of the strata gradually increases in amount, proceeding from south to north, or from Annals of the Poor," by the late Bev.
