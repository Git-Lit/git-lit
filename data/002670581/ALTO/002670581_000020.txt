6 WEALDEN FORMATION, Some of the slabs exhibit potamides, cyclas, and cyrena upon their surfaces ; and others, the teeth and bones of small fish, turtles, and their remains. The carapace of a turtle was found a little distance from Barnes', or Shepherd's Chine, about eighteen months ago, and is now in the Warwick museum. Slabs of the Freshwater limestone may be observed in the cliffs, at an accessible height, and specimens of the black and slate-coloured shale, between the thin layers of which cyprides are contained, which can be collected from the fallen masses on the shore. Between Brook Point and Brixton, masses of the remains of the limbs of pine trees occur. Most of them are partially car bonised, and are either silicified, or impregnated with calcareous matter, whilst many of the pieces are covered with coatings of bright glistening pyrites, the bark of which is transformed into a brittle carbonised mass, resembling coal. In the neighbourhood of Brook, many animal remains are found, the most prominent being the palatial, or crushing teeth, of the Lepidotus Mantelli, with its lozenge-shaped black enamelled scales, bearing a high polish. Between here and Atherfield Point, the bones of reptiles are periodically washed out of the cliffs by the sea, as well as teeth. of reptiles and fish. Many of these remains are to be found on the strand, at low water, when the sea recedes at times to a great distance, leaving the level clayey bottom exposed over a vast surface, laying bare (especially after a storm) the buried remains of the extinct animals. East of Barnes' Chine a bed of hard, grey, gritty sandstone occurs, much impregnated with iron, con taining Unios. At Sudmore, in a band of coarse,
