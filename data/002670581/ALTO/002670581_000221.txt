T0TLANDS bay. 163 Lacrustine Beds of Totlands Bay. These beds " occupy the upper part of the cliff in Totlands Bay, for a distance of nearly 350 yards, and form a deposit of very variable character. On the top is an unequal thickness of brown loam, containing a few scattered angular flints, beneath which is a layer of brown clay and perished shells, resting on four or five feet of calcareous tufa (with a few black lines derived from decomposed vegetable matter), sometimes equalling fluvio-marine limnæan limestone in hardness. This tufa is finest in the upper part, and becomes gradually coarser towards the bottom, where it is full of round calcareous concretions of various sizes, and of what seem to be the twigs and stems of plants, which, having fallen into the water highly charged with carbonate of lime, became enveloped by it. The concentric concretions are largest at the base of the deposit, and decrease in size in an upward direction, the whole deposit resting on an uneven surface of the Eocene Potamomya sands, which underlie the Limæan limestone of Totlands Bay. Occasionally there is a layer of small angular flints intervening between the tufa and the sands. The whole of the deposit in question seems to have been quietly and gradually formed in a hollow beneath the waters of a pool or small lake which received the surface drainage of the surrounding higher ground. A portion only of the bed of this lake now remains, which probably ceased to exist when, by the wearing away of the land, the sea cliffs encroached upon its western margin, and thus drained it of its water.
