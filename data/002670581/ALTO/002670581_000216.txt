158 TERTIARY SERIES. " In entering upon the Tertiary series of formations we find ourselves upon the threshold of the modern type of life. The ages of lycopods, ferns, cycads, and yew-like conifera have passed away, and that of the dicotyledonous angiosperms — the hard-wood trees and evergreens of to-day — now succeed them ; but not by any sudden extinction and re-creation ; for, as we have seen, some of these trees had already begun to make their appearance even in cretaceous times. The hippurites, inocerami, ammonites, belemnites, baculites, turrelites, scaphites, and other mollusses, which had played so large a part in the molluscan life of the later secondary periods, now cease. The great reptiles, too, which in such wonderful variety of type were the dominant animals of the earth's surface, alike on land and sea, ever since the commencement of the Lias, now wane before the increase of the Mammalia, which advance in augmenting diversity of type, until they reach a maximum in variety of form and in bulk just before the cold epoch referred to. When the refrigeration passed away and the climate became milder, the extraordinary development of mammalian life that pre ceeded it is found to have disappeared also, being only feebly represented in the living fauna, at the head of which man has taken his place." Superficial Accumulations of Later Tertiary Date. " All the superficial deposits in the Isle of Wight are of later Tertiary date. They may be divided into two kinds : first, the older gravel covering the high
