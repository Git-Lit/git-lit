98 chalk formation. The characteristic fossils of this bed are : — Ammonites Rhotomagensis Baculites Faujasii Tnrrelites costatus (com.) varians Scaphites striatus I Hamites attenuatns Unmitps attetniatus. About three or four feet above, two bands occur, consisting of an upper and lower, and are intercalated between the soft argillaceous material before described. They are about one foot to eighteen inches apart. The lowermost is composed of a hard buff-coloured material and contains but few fossils. The upper is more laminated, and contains — Scaphites striatus (com.) Ammonites Rhotomagensis Ammonites varians Holaster planus Above these fossiliferous zones, which are from fifty to sixty feet from the basement bed, the fossils become scanty, and many of the species named dis appear. As the strata approaches the Grey Chalk, its lithological character becomes changed and more laminated. The following fossils are most frequently met with : — Ammonites catinus Scaphites costatus Nautilus radiatus navicularis Sussexensis Pecten Beaverii
