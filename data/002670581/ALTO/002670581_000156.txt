108 CHALK FORMATION. of hauling towards him, from the sides of the ledges, the rope by which he descended. Many of these ledges project seaward to the extent of several feet, and in descending it was necessary to swing outwards to such a distance — and probably at a distance of from four to five hundred feet above the sea — as would give a returning impetus sufficient to ensure a landing upon the ledges where the birds congregated. These ledges are composed of the harder portions of the chalk, the softer being weathered out, leaving excavations of sufficient depth to provide the birds with shelter. A recent Act, protecting the birds during the the breeding season (by establishing a close-time) has caused this calling to cease. I have been told that formerly a rental was paid for the exclusive right of obtaining and selling the eggs to collectors. This monopoly, however, suffered many encroachments from those who, desirous to obtain the eggs — as much, perhaps, from love of adventure as profit — found means to evade any recognition of " rights." This Act has been valuable in somewhat staying the destruction of the birds, but unfortunately many are still annually destroyed for the sake of the profit arising from the sale of their skins and feathers. This is much to be regretted, not only on account of their value as "scavengers of the sea," but for their use in heavy fogs, in warning sailors of the close proximity of land. Among the most characteristic of the birds that habitually frequent the cliffs are the Guillimot, Puffin (whose numbers, however, are much decreased), Razor Bill, Cormorant, Shag, and Herring-Gull. The Cormorant at one time built on the Needles rocks. Samphire, which grows in abundance on the cliffs,
