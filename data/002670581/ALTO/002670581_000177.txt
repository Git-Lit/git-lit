LOWER EOCENE STRATA. 125 in Sussex, East and West Kent, Surrey. In the Isle of Wight, they are said to be unfossiliferous, with the exception of plants sparingly distributed. They appear to be made up of the deltritus of the Chalk, Upper Greensand and Gault, deposited in a state of silt, con sisting mainly of decomposed Chalk, and owe their varieties of color to the mixture of the above named strata, with probably the addition of infiltrations of iron. " In Alum Bay, the Plastic Clay is 84ft. thick, increasing till it reaches 163ft. in Whitecliff Bay" (Bristow). It is extensively used in the manufacture of bricks and pottery, hence its name given to it by Mr. Prestwich. Some time ago, in a deep cutting near Boscombe Down, an interesting section was exposed showing the junction between the â€¢' PlasticClay " and the White Chalk. The formation following that of the Plastic Clay, consists of a brown Sandy Clay with Septaria, Sandstones and Clays, which were classified by the old geologists as the " Bognor Beds," on account of the Fossils having been identified with those of the Lower Eocene of the Isle of Wight. " The rocks at Bognor are evidently the ruins of a deposit once very extensive, and which, even within the memory of man formed a low line of cliffs along the coast ; at present a few groups of detached rocks, covered by the sea at high water, alone remain and the period is not far distant when these will be swept away by the action of the waves. These beds are decidedly analogous to the Calcaire Grossiard of Paris."* I have quoted this to show that there is hardly a doubt but that the Island once joined Sussex, and * Mantell, "Geology of the S.E. of England," p. 61.
