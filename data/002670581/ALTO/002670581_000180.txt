128 TERTIARY SERIES. The pebble bed at Whitecliff Bay is overlaid by a layer of buff-coloured sands ; above this lies a bed of hard sandstone, full of Ditrupa plana, which runs out to the sea, and is visible at low water.. Many years ago, when working in Whitecliff Bay on the Lower Tertiaries, I detected a second bed of Ditrupa further to the west than that mentioned by Prof. Forbes. To all appearance this band was in the mottled clays, and consisted of a very coarse red sand. Prof. Prestwich, in his ". Basement Bed of the London Clay,"* gives a section of this locality, and mentions the occurrence of two deposits containing Ditrupa. Possibly the bed I refer to is the lower one of the two given in his section. The floor of the Bay, especially during the prevalence of a west wind, is at times swept clean by the waves, but this, and other ridges of the harder strata, are frequently covered with sand for weeks together. It will be as well to state that about 35 feet from the basement there is a zone of Panopæa intermedia, and Pholadomya margaritacœ, both shells occuring with their valves closed, showing that death overtook them in the position in which they aire now found. At 50ft. the band of Ditrupa plana occurs, and at 80ft. a well marked band of small Cardita planicosta, indicating the passage into the Bracklesham beds. * Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc, vi. 1850, p. 256.
