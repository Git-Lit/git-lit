In a pit on the right side of a path over the Downs, the Upper Chalk is seen reduced to pipe clay, in which nodules of white flints are imbedded, and the bowl shaped excavations are filled with water. The clay preventing the water from being absorbed by the chalk thus preserves natural reservoirs for the sheep and cattle. " To a thinking mind few phenomena are more strange than the state of little ponds on the summit of chalk hills, many of which are never dry in the most trying droughts of summer And again what appears to me still more remarkable is the fact that soon after a new pond has been made and has received a partial supply of water from a few passing showers, it becomes inhabited by various kinds of freshwater plants and shell fish, and even frogs and lizards, although it may be remote from any other pond, and at an elevation of 400 or 500 feet above the level of the surrounding country."* I once observed the same phenomena in a small hole of water, half way down a path at the west end of Whitecliff Bay, at the junction of the Chalk and the Tertiary, from which I attempted to drink, but found it so stocked with tadpoles and other creatures that I was obliged to pass on without refreshing myself. The gravel on the hill tops on the southern side of the Island appears to be the same age as those of the central ridge, and with them perhaps may be included the valley deposits of which I have spoken. â€¢White's "Natural History of Selborne."
