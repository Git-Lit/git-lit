74 THE UPPER GREENSAND. were in such a friable state as to be quite untrans portable. I therefore take as a basis a bed of what appears to be Gault, being much darker and more compact than the grey micaceous clay and sand on which it rests, indicating an almost sudden change from these to Gault. It contains in some places masses of a dark shaly substance, and is full of the remains of Serpula antiquata. At its base is a thin band of hard blue chert containing the crushed shells ofa large Inoceramus, on the top of which is another bed of the same material, also containing Inocerami in a more perfect condition, with Panop√¶a. The total thickness of these lower beds is about three feet. They contain the first organic remains which can be recognised in the series. The next thirty feet above consists of soft yellow micaceous sands, divided by layers of large nodules or concretions of Rag, about five or six in number. These nodules, in shape like a compressed cone, are circular, and measure from a few inches to three or four feet in diameter. Nearly all of them, especially those of the lower zones, contain, with the layers of Rag, many fossils, such as large Ammonites (A. rostratus, A. inflatus); and groups of fossils often occur in them. Some of the lower concretions have a central elevation, and some have a phosphatic tube-like structure in the centre, often four or five sided ; they are quite common in the lower beds of the black shaly masses mentioned. The layers of Rag and nodules are all coated with the soft micaceous sandy matrix in which they are imbedded, which weathers off on exposure to the elements, often exhibiting fossils in relief on their surfaces, especially in the cliffs East of Blackgang
