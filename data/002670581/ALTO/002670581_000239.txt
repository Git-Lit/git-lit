THE UNDERCLIFF. 181 There are numerous terraces on the sides of the Downs ; those on Steephill Down, between Ventnor and St. Lawrence, are well defined. Seen at a distance they look like roads cut artificially in the slopes. A near view, shows that their surfaces, unlike roads, are not horizontal, but almost coincide with the slope of the hills on which they occur. They have also been formed by denudation. Landslips, like those which take place occasionally round the coast of the British Islands, can be compared with earthquakes, in their work of devastation and ruin. Alike their work of destruction is carried out swiftly and without warning. The land, already saturated by land springs, and broken up by falls from its own weight and frosts, yields itself a helpless mass to the never ceasing attacks of the sea in its front. " The scenery of the irregular terrace (strangely called the Undercliff), with its boundary lines of cliff above and below, is too well known to require a des cription The upper cliff, or rampart, of chalk and greensand is very instructive, as throwing light on the mode in which many inland escarpments may have originated. It is true that there is room for differences of opinion concerning the relative share the sea and fresh water may have had in the formation of this remarkable wall of rock ; but I think there can be little doubt that, if the sea had never encroached on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, the upper line of cliff would never have existed. It is the effect of a coast slip or a series of coast slips, and may correctly be called an indirect, or supra-marine sea-cliff."* â€¢ Mackintosh, " Scenery of England and Wales." p. 38.
