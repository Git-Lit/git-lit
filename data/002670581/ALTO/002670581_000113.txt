FOURTH DIVISION. 79 An irregular layer of misshapen phosphatic nodules is imbedded between the last-named layer and the Chloritic Marl above. These nodules are derived ; many of them have the remains of sponges and shells adhering to them, and some of them have the appear ance of having been pierced by Lithodomi. Interstrati fied with them are various species of Sponges, Polyzoa, etc., with Shark and reptilian remains. Imbedded on these nodules is a seam of green sandy materials marked by meandering lines, and patches of marl upon the upper part, which is unfossiliferous in the neigh bourhood of Ventnor, particularly in the lower part, in contact with the nodules. This seam is of a dark green colour, and contains Saurian remains, with Pecten asper, P. orbicularis, and Pecten quinquecostatus. Upwards from the dark green sandy beds the deposits gradually merge into that of a light grey colour with dark grains. In some localities this bed is permeated by iron, but its composition partakes largely of marl. This is the first indication of a change from chert Rag and sandstone to the Chalk into which it gradually merges. It is full of fossils and fragments of fossils, and sponge-like bodies, mostly phosphatic, and Ammonites. It weathers easily, when numerous fossils are exposed in relief on the surface of the fallen blocks which strew the shore of the Undercliff. From the waterworn appearance of most of the organic remains they seem to have been derived from some older stratum, and to have been deposited under the influence of strong currents.* Curiously enough, I came upon two distinct specimens of Ammonites â€¢ These deposits are again referred to further on.
