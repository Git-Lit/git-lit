60 THE LOWER GREENSAND. predominated over the clays, each interval of deposition being usually marked by the presence of a layer of Exogyra sinuata, the period of rest being almost always sufficient to enable the Exogyra to attain its full growth. Other bivalves are found with it, but in comparatively small numbers, and not such as are of gregarious habits. During the whole of this period enormous Cephalopoda, including species of Crioceras and Scaphites, frequented these seas, and when dead formed the nuclei round which calcareous and sandy matter collected and formed nodules. The death of these animals seems to have been connected with the periodical charging of the sea with sediment ; hence we find them usually alternating with the zones of Exogyra, and forming irregular bands in the intervening sedimentary deposits. " ' In the midst of this epoch of Exogyra there is a sudden reappearance of the muddy deposits, during the predominance of which those animals adapted for such a sea-bottom, and which had survived the cessation of the deposits of the fullers' earth, again multiplied, but the species which had become extinguished were not replaced by representative forms. This, however, did not last long, the sand again predominating, with its zones of Exogyra and lines of Crioceras nodules. " ' A temporary multiplication of Terebratula sella suddenly marks a change in the zoological conditions, for the Cephalopoda disappear, although the zones of Exogyra, which animal does not appear to have been affected by the change (probably a change in the depth of the sea) go on as before, there being, however, no alternating lines of nodules. It would seem that the sea began to shallow, probably from elevation of the
