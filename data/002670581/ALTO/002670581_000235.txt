Â©mutation ano Hanosltps. fHE contour of the Isle of Wight, and the rounded slopes of its chalk-hills are often broken abruptly by spurs and cliffs, due, in JffiftV most part, to the excessive denudation un- rf _tjj V!ir/-> dergone by the Island in past ages. A good instance occurs in the vale of Newchurch, where the whole of the superincumbent strata down to the Lower Greensand has been removed ; whilst on the eastern side of the same valley even that has disappeared, and we have one of the two patches of Wealden beds exposed. The successive strata, following the chalk, may be seen in many places in the roads leading to the Downs from Messly to the Spur, which terminates St. George's Down, where a thick bed of rounded gravel rests upon the Lower Greensand, forming, with peroxide of iron, a conglomerate, or pudding-stone. On the southern side of the valley is the picturesque village of Newchurch, the houses extending along the ridge in a westerly direction, in a line with the Church, whilst high above them lies a thick bed of gravel, through which a road has been cut called " Skinner's Hill." The gravel marks the former extension of the chalk, the strata themselves having disappeared. M
