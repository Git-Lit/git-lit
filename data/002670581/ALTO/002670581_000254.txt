196 THE HUMAN PERIOD. vegetable mould, interspersed with loose stones from the adjoining Upper Greensand formation. The Church stands in the upper part of the Churchyard, and, as the gravedigger informed me, there was no doubt but that the "midden" heap extended below the founda tions of the Church, as he had himself proved it to exist in digging the graves in different parts of the ground. The Church was built more than 800 years ago. No previous examination of the ground of this locality had been made, public attention having been only just then excited by the discovery of the remains of man, accompanied by those of flint implements. Excavations in a rough piece of ground in the garden at Winterbourne, Bonchurch, brought to light a flint arrow-head, a scraper, and what appeared to be a spear head with the top fractured. This latter imple ment had been formed from a fragment of the Chert beds of the Upper Greensand, and had probably been throw-n aside on account of its broken condition. It is now in the collection at the Literary Institute, Ventnor. Roman remains (coins and pottery) have been discovered in the village. It may be surmised that a colony of ancient Britons once formed a settlement near this spot, and were suffered to remain in undisturbed possession by their Roman conquerors. The locality was well chosen,' sheltered, and close to a splendid stream of pure water. Of the bones that were discovered most of them had been broken across the centre, presumably for the purpose of extracting the marrow. Fragments of bone, treated in a similar manner, are very often met with ; they have been found in the Kirkdale Caves and elsewhere.
