148 TERTIARY SERIES. The Limestone in Whitecliff Bay forms a con spicuous and well-developed member of the Eocene strata. It rises from the shore into a cliff with a rapid and sudden curve, forming in great part the floor of the Bay between it and Foreland Point ; it constitutes the reef of rocks known as Bembridge Ledge, the extremity of which extends far out to sea, and on this a light ship, known as the Nab light, is stationed. The creamy whiteness and angular fracture of these beds make them conspicuous among the neighbouring strata, even at a distance. The four groups have the following characteristic distinctions : â€” Group 1. Marls and clays with Melania turritissima, Cerithium mutabile and Cyrena pulchra. Group 2. Clays and Marls with bones of turtle Group 3. The least in extent, but important as shewing the evident influx of salt water during its depo sition, as traced by the oyster and marine shell remains. It forms a narrow band between the marls and limestones, and can be best examined in Whitecliff Bay and below St. Helen's. It also occurs on the shore at Hempstead and Thorness. Group 4. Comprises the uppermost limestone of Headon Hill, Sconce, Hempstead Ledge, Gurnet Bay, Cowes, Binstead, Dodpits, and between Stony Cross and Place on the western part of the Island, and Bembridge on the eastern.
