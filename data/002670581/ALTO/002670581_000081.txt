JUNCTION BED. 57 Greensand, Gault, Upper Greensand, and Lower and Upper Chalk, appear in succession, as at Messly. On arriving at the summit of the hill leading up to the Blackgang Hotel, a magnificent panorama presents itself to the view on the right. A chain of chalk hills ("the central ridge") stretches away to the west, terminating in the promontory at Freshwater. Beneath the headland formed by them are those once vast outliers of chalk, long since separated from the cliff by the disintegrating power of the sea, resting upon fissured and shattered strata, dislocated and rent by upheaval, known as " The Needles Rocks." In the intervening space, between the chalk hills and the coast, all the strata have disappeared down to the Lower Greensand and the Wealden, forming an extensive valley of denudation of many square acres in extent, which consist of cultivated fields and green meadows, separated by trim hedge rows, whilst farm houses and cottages are seen dotted here and there, amidst clumps of stately elms, with the towers of the village churches peeping out from amidst the trees and foliage, giving to the whole that peculiar charm inci dental to an English rural landscape. Looking seaward is seen the lofty dark red cliffs of Atherfield, and their headland, from which extends a ledge far away to sea. Beyond, again, are the low red and yellow cliffs of the Wealden, with Brook Point in the distance ; also Chale Bay, beginning at Rocken End and ending at Atherfield Point. The whole forming a series of headlands and indentations, caused by the inroads of the sea upon the softer portions of the deposits, leaving the harder strata before described, which form the headlands and ledges.
