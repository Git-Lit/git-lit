Although little or nothing of the Geology of the Isle of Wight was known in Sir Richard Worsley's time (1780), that author mentions these lignites on page 7 of his " History of the Island ": â€” " A stratum of coals runs through the ridge of hills before mentioned. It appears at the foot of Bembridge Cliff a little to the northward of the Point and somewhat above low water mark. It is seen on the side of Arreton Down, and at the west end of the Island, near WTarden Ledge, in the parish of Freshwater. This stratum has a vein of white sand and fullers earth lying on the north, and one of red ochre on the south side ; the upper part of it is about three feet wide, and descends in an oblique direction northward, to an uncertain depth. The late Sir Richard Worsley sunk a shaft for it, on his estate at Bembridge, but found the vein so thin that, fearing it would not answer the expense, he desisted from the undertaking. How it lies in other parts of the Island may perhaps be sometime or other worth the trial, as the coal is of good quality." "The lower part of this group is represented in Whitecliff Bay by green clayey sands with Cardita planicosta, Turritella imbricataria, Venus, etc. There are six zones of fossils altogether, and the Cardita is not only much less in size than the species found at Bracklesham, but is pierced by small boring shells, showing that the animals must have perished, and the shells have remained a considerable time at the bottom of the sea before they were covered by the sediment in which they are now buried. Lignite Clays succeed the above, with green clayey
