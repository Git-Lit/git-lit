WHITE CHALK. 111 infinitude of space, until touching faintly the line of the distant horizon, it appears to blend almost imper ceptibly with the sky. As has been stated above, the excavation of the caves is mainly due to the sea ; the upper portions of the cliffs being broken away sub sequently by the combined actions of the atmospheric forces, of which frost is the chief factor. The following quotation from Mr. Bristow's " Geology of the Isle of Wight " will assist the reader to form a better idea of the process of destruction which is continually in pro gress : " Besides the lines of bedding, the chalk is traversed by joints dividing it into large cubical masses. It is on account of the structure described above that the chalk cliffs on the sea-coast usually form steep and almost mural precipices, for when the action of the waves has undermined a portion of the cliffs to such an extent that the cohesion of the rock is insufficient to support its own weight, it gives way in the direction of the vertical joints, the line of fracture presenting a nearly plane surface which is almost at right angles to the bedding."* The white chalk, judging from the number of its disused pits, appears at one time to have been exten sively quarried. Many of them are now covered with the short turf characteristic of the Chalk Downs, and in one pit, on the north side of Arreton Down, an Ash has grown to an height of full 30 feet. The largest Upper Chalk pits in the Island are those of Downend (near Arreton) and Brading Down ; neither yield many fossils, though in Downend pit some few Echini, Spondyli, and sponges rarely occur.
