ECONOMICS. 235 pronounced it excellent in quality, but not sufficient in quantity to cover the expense of smelting. Large quantities of it are strewed along the shore. Cement Stones are obtained to a small extent from Alum Bay, but the greatest supply is now derived from the opposite coast of Hampshire, where the Septaria, which once formed a portion of the Barton beds, are procured by dredging (Geological Survey, p. 107). The manufacture of cement is carried on in mills on the west bank of the Medina, below Newport, by the Messrs. Francis, of Nine Elms, London, in which the Septaria dredged from the bed of the Solent are manufactured into cement, giving employment to a great number of hands. At Gurnard Bay, seventy years ago, quarries of the Bembridge Limestone were much worked, and some of the fortifications at Portsmouth were constructed from them. Hassel states that in fine weather there were three or four sloops trading with this limestone. It is still used, both in the Island and elsewhere (see p. 152). The white Pipe-Clay of the Lower Bagshot beds, which is so largely developed in Dorsetshire, almost entirely disappears in the Isle of Wight, being replaced there by sands. In Alum Bay the Pipe-Clay is repre sented by a bed only six feet thick ; but it still retains its usual characters, and is marked by the presence of leaves of plants resembling those which are found associated with the corresponding clays of Dorsetshire. Between Alum Bay and Freshwater Gate the Pipe
