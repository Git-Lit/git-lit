1 86 DENUDATION AND LANDSLIPS. places. Whatever road or path had formerly existed through the place had been effaced, and with some difficulty I passed over the avalanche, which extended many hundred yards. Proceeding eastward, the whole of the soil seemed to have moved, and was filled with chasms and bushes, lying in every direction. The intricate and rugged path became gradually less distinct, and soon divided into mere sheep tracks, leading into an almost impenetrable thicket. I per ceived, however, the lofty wall of rock which belonged to the same stratum as the Undercliff, softened in its rugged character by the foliage which grew in its fissures, and still preserving some remains of its former picturesque beauty. Neglect, and the unfortunate accident which had lately happened, had now altered the features of this once delightful spot, and I was soon bewildered among rocks, streams of water, and tangling briars." Several slips have since occurred, but cannot be compared in extent with that of East End, or of another, described as - follows by an eye-witness : â€” " The ground lies in waves or folds like the billows of an agitated ocean, or perhaps it still more nearly resembles turf broken up by the action of an enormous plough." When the geological structure of the Undercliff is examined, it will be readily seen that, owing to the imperviousness of the Gault, the surface waters flow out between it and the Upper Greensand. The Chalk Marl and Upper Greensand, both water-bearing rocks, would readily become charged, and fissured and split up by frosts, and would slide off in the direction of the least resistance by their own weight.
