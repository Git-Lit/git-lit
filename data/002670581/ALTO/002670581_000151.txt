WHITE CHALK. 105 the lower to the upper strata, becoming nearly vertical at the junction with the Tertiary strata, where the beds become hard, and are traversed by layers of flints. The bands of flints are well displayed in the cliff sections between Sun Corner and the junction with the Tertiary strata in Alum Bay, where they appear as parallel layers, presenting a striking contrast, from their blackness, to the snowy aspect of the chalk. The rocks, called " The Needles," are enormous wedge-shaped masses of chalk standing out in the sea, which have become isolated from the great body of the chalk forming the mainland, by the wasting action of the waves upon the coast. Though conspicuous objects at a distance, on account of their position and snowy whiteness, they are of much larger dimensions than they seem to be when viewed from the mainland, and a base of 60 feet in diameter has been levelled on one of them for the foundations of the new light house, the site of which has been removed to it from High Down.* It is recorded that the Needles derive their name from a spiral shaped rock, 120 feet high, which became gradually undermined by the action of the sea, yielding at last, and falling with so great a force that the shock reverberated throughout the Island, and, it is said, was felt as far as Portsmouth. This took place in 1764. There is a small engraving of the rock on page 25 of Sir Richard Worsley's " History of the Island." The present Needles Lighthouse was erected by the Trinity Board, and its friendly warning light was first seen on the night of January ist, 1859. â€¢ Mem.
