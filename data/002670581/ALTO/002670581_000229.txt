st. Catherine's down. 171 the form of a conical-shaped rock, its large water-worn fragments resembling in form and colour the flint pebbles of the present beach. The rock is known by the fishermen as the " Bean Rock," on account of the resemblance of its smaller pebbles to beans, and a portion of a reef which extends to some depth. For a long time I was puzzled to account for the occurrence of this mass, so unlike the deposits of the neighbourhood, and in such an isolated position ; until some workmen who were engaged in excavating the beach below the waterfall, for sewerage purposes, came at some depth from the surface upon masses of shingle and rounded flint-pebbles, cemented together more or less firmly, in precisely the same manner as the Bean Rock. Its consolidation had without doubt been accomplished by the carbonate of lime contained in the falling water which had percolated through the pebbly beach, and cemented the loose stones. From this I gathered that the conglomerate rock and adjacent ledge had been formed under the same conditions (exposure to the air having probably perfected its consolidation), and that the ledge evidently was the remains of an ancient sea-beach, which at one time formed that part of the shore facing the old mill stream. Its distance from the site of the present beach may have been due to the depression of the land ; or still more probably to the weight of the disrupted strata, which must have accompanied the formation of the Undercliff, having forced it seawards. During the construction of a pier in 1865 an attempt was made to remove this ledge and rock by gunpowder ; the only result, however, was the dislodgement of a few fragments, which were carried away as curiosities
