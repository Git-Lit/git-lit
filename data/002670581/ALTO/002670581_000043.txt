Consequently, they are the base ment beds of over 2,000 feet of sedimentary strata — accumulated upon them. The organic remains — many of which bear the appearance of extensive abrasion, and seem to have been transported from long distances, whilst others appear to be indiginous to the formation — are stated to have been an ancient shell bed — a modern equivalent of which, dredgers tell us, is now accumu lating in the North Sea.
