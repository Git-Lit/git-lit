There cannot be a doubt but the depression of the Chalk strata, extending from the Needles to the coast of Dorsetshire, would greatly aid the sea in breaking through the barrier and of forming the existing channel at that end of the Island, between the Needles and Hurst Castle. The spot selected for this latter building is most singularly situated at the end of a long bank of shingle, extending in a curved line nearly two miles from the Hampshire coast. It must be of great solidity, as the depth of the channel at the beginning of the present century, close to the Castle, was no less than thirty-three fathoms, and the tide pours through it with such rapidity that a four oared boat can scarcely stem it. Hurst Castle, as I have before stated, is situated at the extremity of a tongue of shingle (or probably clay flints). It was originally one of Henry VIII.'s forts, and is now an important signal station, commanding the passage of the Solent, and has a battery for the defence of the Channel, being immediately opposite the forts of the Isle of Wight.
