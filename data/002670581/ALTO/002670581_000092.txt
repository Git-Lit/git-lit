66 THE LOWER GREENSAND. This portion of the coast, for probably centuries, was sadly celebrated for shipwrecks, and, unfortunately loss of life and property. One of the most terrible on' record was that of the " Clarendon," West Indiaman, of 350 tons burden, on her homeward voyage from St. Kitts, with 11 passengers and 17 seamen, all of whom perished, on the morning of the nth October, 1836, with the exception of the mate and two seamen. After this catastrophe the authorities, in 1840, erected the St. Catherine's lighthouse, since which there has been a great diminution of wrecks at this spot, which, from their frequent occurrence, and the continual loss of life, in bygone days was not inaptly called " The Bay of Death." Among the yellow shingle and sand which covers the shore to some depth, gold dust, Spanish dollars, ignots of silver, coins, jewellry, pigs of lead, etc., have been found by old shore walkers, during this and the last century, memorials of long-forgotten wrecks, which finds have been handed down by tradition and history, reminding one of the dream of Clarence, wherein the sea-bottom was laid bare of its objects, which are thus described : — " Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks, A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon, — Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea. Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in these holes Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept (As 'twere in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep, And mock'd the dead bones that lay scattered by."
