1 84 DENUDATION AND LANDSLIPS. The extensive reefs stretching seaward from every headland on the south coast, forming the horns of the bays along the shore, from Compton Bay on the west, to Bembridge or the Foreland on the east, are evidences of the great destruction of land wrought by the sea. These reefs are remains of strata which, by their harder nature, have been able to resist the power by which the softer portions have been destroyed. The most noted reefs are "Bull's Face" and "Brook Ledge," which form Brixton Bay, whose cliffs are formed of the Wealden Clays. Atherfield Ledge or Bench, and Rockenend Ledge, or St. Catherine's Point, form the two extremities of Chale Bay. The distance between these points cannot be less than three miles, and each point projects several miles into the sea in a southerly direction. Their extent, as has before been stated, is indicated by the disturbance of the sea. Woody Point, about a mile-and-a-quarter from Ventnor, is a headland with a reef projecting seawards to a great distance. Sandown Bay is formed by Shanklin Ledge and Point on the west and Culver Cliffs on the east. Whitecliff Bay has the Culver Cliffs at its western extremity and Bembridge Point and Ledge at its eastern. Both Bays are examples of the extent to which a deposit of sands and clays can be hollowed out, and carried away by the sea. Entering upon the historic period it will be seen that the unusual causes which produced the Undercliff have been repeated occasionally since on a smaller scale ; probably the same phenomena will again act upon the isolated portions of the great wall, with similar results, though in a lesser proportion.
