They thin out gradually but rapidly towards the north, and disappear altogether in an easterly direction, being represented by sands and marls in Whitecliff Bay. The lower of the two thick limestones belonging to this series at Headon Hill is represented by the band forming How Ledge, between Colwell and Totlands Bays north of East Cowes, a little round the first Point, light green and red sandy clays, with bands of compressed Melania costata and bivalves, form ing a shell-marl, have slipped from a higher level on to the shore, and Paludina lenta, Cyrena obovata, Potamides (Cerithium) concavus, etc., one in a silicified condition, lie scattered in great profusion on the beach."* Between How Ledge and Lynchen Chine the strata have been contorted, and this can be well seen in the face of the cliff. Several beds of Clay Ironstone occur near Norris, separating the fossiliferous clays. This series has yielded a long and important series of organic remains, as the following list will show :-— Chara and Carpolithes Cythere (3 sp.) Balanus Cytheridea (3 sp ) Pollicipes Cytherella Serpnla (2 sp.) Cythereis And amongst the Mollusca : — Cyrena Unio Corbula Melanopsis Helix Murex Lymnæa (20 sp.)
