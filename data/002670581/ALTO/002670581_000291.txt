ADDENDUM. 233 "2. Petrifactions, are the remains of animals and vegetables in which the original structure is converted into stone, or, in other words, is petrified ; such are the silicified stems of trees from Antigua and Germany, and the bones and shells in the Oolitic and Wealden limestones. Such petrifactions may be correctly termed fossil plants, bones, or shells ; but similar organic remains, though of equal antiquity, which have not undergone such changes, are not petrifactions in the proper meaning of that term. " 3. Incrustations, are neither fossils nor petrifactions, but simply durable parts of animals or vegetables invested with travertine or calcareous deposit, which is often compact and of crystalline hardness, but does not permeate the structure of the enclosed substances ; such are the so-called petrified eggs, skulls, nests, branches, etc., formed by immersion in the incrusting springs of Derbyshire and other localities."
