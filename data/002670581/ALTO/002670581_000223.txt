Catherine's down. 165 They likewise differ from the beds in Totlands Bay in containing neither the remains of numerous shells of Helix aperta, H. aspersa, H. nemoralis, H. ericetorum, H. virgata, H. rotundata, Bulimus lubricus, etc., and small fragments of chalk, Upper Green sandstone (with occasionally a small fossil from the latter formation) and chert sparingly disseminated throughout The thickness of this deposit does not exceed nine feet. It may readily be distinguished from the chalk by its darker colour, and by its forming a slightly receding and vertical wall-like cliff, while the chalk and chloritic marl upon which it reposes are of a whiter hue, and slope gently from its base towards the edge of the cliff."* Coarse gravels occur along the surface of the terrace which forms the Undercliff, at different heights ; they are fully exposed in the neighbourhood of Ventnor and Bonchurch, and consist of (more especially in the upper portions) angular blocks of the adjacent strata of Upper Greensand, nodules of flints, and masses of Chalk Marl, in some cases associated with dark loam, and smaller pieces of the same rocks. A good section about six feet thick may be seen in a cutting for a new road, on the Steephill estate, above the Castle, leading to the Wroxall road. The deposits continue to the left of the road leading to Ventnor, and contain large quantities of land shells, especially Cyclostoma elegans. In a quarry near the cliff a large quantity of this deposit have been washed into a fissure, completely filling it. To the right of the Zig-zag Road, near Steephill view, another thick and similar bed occurs, in which bones and teeth of the horse, hog, * Mem. Geol. Surv., Bristow, Isle of Wight, 1862, p. 99.
