On the left side of this cup I found a human skull, the jaw and splendid teeth of which touched the rim of the cup, and on the right side of the skull, above the ear, a wedge-shaped hole, 2 inches long, and nearly half an inch wide, cleanly cut in the bone, as if by a sharp weapon. " Upon further removing the earth, I laid bare the skeleton of a well-grown man, apparently more than 6 feet high, and buried in a sitting position. Most of the ribs and other small bones, together with a portion of the jaw, had crumbled away, the body being so placed and doubled up, as to bring the knees level with the chest. This fact suggests the idea that it is the grave of an ancient Briton.

The skeleton lay or sat east and west. I could not discover any remnant of metal of any description. On either side of the skeleton were two smooth stones, the size and shape of an egg ; one a flint, the other a shore pebble.
