Professor Jones has kindly pointed out to me, through a friend, the interesting comparison to be made between the Hampshire Basin and the Wealden area of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. In the former, as stated above, the original configuration of the surface being synclinal has decided the flow of the river from the higher edges to the centre of the basin, where flowed a larger river, and received them as tributaries. In the case of the Wealden area, however, the beds having been anticlinal, the rivers have flowed from near the centre to the margins of the district. As the surface became gradually lowered by subærial denudation, these rivers deepened their beds, and now present the appearance of having cut through and across the encircling ridges of chalk, the relics of the original bed once probably continuous over all the area. A sketch-map, showing very clearly the distribution of these early rivers in prehistoric ages, is to be seen in a " Lecture on the Antiquity of Man," which was delivered by Professor Rupert Jones to the Croydon Microscopical Club in 1876,* in Boyd Dawkins' " Early Man in Britain,"! and elsewhere.
