TERTIARY SERIES. 134 Before closing these remarks on the Lower and Middle Bagshot series, a short description of the coloured sands may not be out of place, I will give it in Sir Henry Englefield's words, for he, more than any other writer, makes his narrative both graphic and poetical : — " The magical repose of this side of the Bay is wonderfully contrasted by the torn forms and vivid colouring of the clay cliffs on the opposite side ; these do not, as at Whitecliff, present rounded headlands clothed with turf and shrubs, but offer a series of points of a scalloped form, and which are often sharp and pinnacled. " Deep, rugged chasms divide the strata in many places, and not a trace of vegetation appears in any part ; all is wild ruin. " The tints of the cliffs are so bright and so varied, that they have not the aspect of anything natural. Deep, purplish red, dusky blue, bright ochreous yellow, grey nearly approaching to white, and absolute black succeed each other as sharply defined as the stripes in silk ; and after rains the sun, which, from about noon to its setting in Summer, illuminates them more and more, giving a brilliancy to some of these nearly as resplendent as the bright lights on real silk. Small vessels often lie in this Bay for the purpose of loading chalk and sand, and they serve admirably to shew the majestic size of the cliffs, under whose side they lie, diminished almost to nothing."* Mr. Webster also notices these sands, as the following words will show : — * Sir Henry Englefield, " Picturesque Account oi the Island," p. 81.
