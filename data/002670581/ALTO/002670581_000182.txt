130 tertiary series. publishing his reports and figuring his specimens in the volumes of the Palæontographical Society. Middle Bagshot Series. " The strata comprised between the well-known glasshouse sands at the base of Headon Hill, and the pipe-clay-bearing sands and clays overlying the London Clay, and grouped together by Mr. Joshua Trimmer as the Middle Bagshot series, were subdivided by him into Barton Clay and Bracklesham Beds. The latter are represented in Alum Bay by clays and marls in the lower part, and by white, yellow, and crimson sands above. The lower beds are remarkable for the quantity of vegetable matter contained in them ; not, however, in the shape of leaves, as is the case in some of the Lower Bagshot beds, but in the form of lignite, constituting solid beds from 15m. to 2ft. 3m. thick. Four of these beds, when fully displayed, constitute conspicuous objects in the cliff — where they project out of the "softer strata — and on the shore, from their black and coal-like appearance. These beds of coal were recently more than usually well displayed, in conse quence of the prevalence of long continued wet weather having worn away the soft intervening strata in which they are imbedded. On examining them during a brief visit made to the Island, in company with Prof. Ramsay, during the Autumn of 1860, it appeared evident that the beds in question occur more in the manner of ordinary coal than of mere lignite. Like true coal, each bed was based upon a stratum of clay, containing, apparently, the rootlets of plants, as in the underclay of the true coal-measures."* • Mem. Geol.
