OSBORNE. 143 The fossils of the Headon beds are repeated along the shore from Headon Hill to East Cowes and Norris Castle. Osborne or St. Helen's Beds. Between the Upper Headon beds, the Bembridge Limestone, and the brackish water bed with Potamomya, that terminates the Headon series, " a considerable thickness of strata intervenes, deserving," writes the late Professor Forbes, "of a distinct appellation on account of their mineralogical and paleontological peculiarities, and of their holding an intermediate character between the Middle and Upper Eocene strata."* Professor Forbes, it appears, named them the " St. Helen's Beds, ' but afterwards designated them the " Osborne series," on finding them displayed in the cliffs under Her Majesty's residence. A little to the west of Osborne they occur in conjunction with the Upper Headon series, whilst a little to the east they underlie the Bembridge Limestone. The lithographical peculiarities are remarkably displayed in these cliffs, but unfortunately visitors to the neighbourhood are unable to study them, as strangers are not admitted to the Royal domains. " In the cliffs and on the shore west of Wootton Creek the Bembridge Limestone rises above variegated red and green marls and clays belonging to this group, though, owing to the landslips, the minute arrange ments of the strata are not easily to be made out." | * Mem.
