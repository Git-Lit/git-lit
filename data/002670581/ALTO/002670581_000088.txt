64 THE LOWER GREENSAND. a firm group of ferruginous beds has stopped the corroding action of the streamlet â€” a thin line of water falls lazily from a height of 74 feet, and is dissipated before it reaches the gloomy vault below. The rocks, instead of the deep black the tourist was led to antici pate, are of a dingy brown, banded with lines of sandy strata. The banks on either side are of but mean height and irregular form. The tourist is fortunate who sees Blackgang Chine during a storm, when the sea runs very high upon the coast, breaking upon the beach in a line of snowy surf, the back draught of it being powerful enough to take a person off his legs, and place him in some considerable danger. But in a gale of wind from the S.W. the line of breakers exhibit waves of a larger size and more magnificent motion than on almost any other part of the English coast. The waves often dash with terrific fury quite into the hollow of the Chine, thence ascending into the air in dense clouds of spray."* After describing the Western Chines Sir Henry Englefield writes : " The next Chine is that at Black gang, directly under the western flank of St. Catherine's Hill. This is a chasm totally different from those already described. It does not wind so far from the shore, neither are its sides quite so steep, but it is much more considerable in depth, as one of its flanks is four hundred feet from the sea beach. The chasm does not, however, descend quite to the sea, as at seventy-four feet above the water a thin stratum of very solid ironstone forms a bed to the little rill which runs through the Chine.
