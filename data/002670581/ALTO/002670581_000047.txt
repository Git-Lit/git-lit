perna mulleti beds. 27 inches above there is a stratum of sandy clay, con taining marine shells. The distance between the layers of fluviatile and marine shells is, therefore, but a few inches, so that portable masses, containing characteristic shells of both formations, may be ex tracted. Although these are not in a good state of preservation ; still, many slabs of the harder layers of the Wealden may be collected, bearing on their surfaces the diamond-shaped enamelled scales and spines of the Hybodus, also Cyclas and Potamides. One of the layers of septaria contains fish remains ; also reptilian remains are by no means uncommon. The lowest beds of the Lower Greensand rest imme diately upon the last named deposits, and are named the Perna beds, the lowest of which rise from the base of the cliff, a short distance below the signal staff of the Coast Guard Station, and form a ledge, extend ing to a long distance out to sea, called Atherfield Bench, which is visible at low water. These beds consist in part of a blue sandy clay and greenish sand, much harder in the upper than in the lower part, and characterised by the prevalence and abundance of the Perna Mulleti, a fossil not occurring in any other part of the formation. These beds, in common with the other strata at Atherfield, take their rise from the base of the cliff, and are prolonged in an upward direction to about from 200 to 300 yards beyond the Point, and run out on the top of the cliff at a spot called " Tie Pits." Resting, as they do, on the Wealden clays, the stratum of which they are composed is always in a state of disintegration, and vast blocks of it, full of fossils, are continually falling on the beach, where they are attacked by the
