WEALDEN FORMATION, 12 are mostly obscured by buildings. It would seem. however, that they come to the surface below the Barracks, underlaid by ferruginous sands and sand stones, which may be seen at the north end of the town. Red and blue clays appear near where once the old Fort stood, just beyond the beds, which up to that point dip towards the south-west, arch over, and dip again in the opposite direction. Towards the north-east their inclination gradually increases. Approaching the Lower Greensand at Red Cliff, between the two extreme points, the Wealden beds are repeated in reverse order, and the laminated grey shales and clays, abounding in cyprides, which, as usual, constitute the Upper part of the beds, re-appear in the face of the cliffs, but only so as to be clearly visible after the occurrence of slips, being at other times concealed by masses of strata, which have fallen from a higher level. I would add that, with the ex ception of a bed of Paludina Sussexensis, below the stile leading to the top of the cliff, few organic remains are to be met with ; in the bank, and in a ridge running out on the strand, they are found in groups, in a crystallised state. Until the new Fort is passed there is very little of interest, if I except the manner in which the strata are tilted up, already described. Below the new Fort, towards Red Cliff, slabs of the disintegrated harder strata, and shelly limestone, make their appearance on the shore ; and about three yards westward from the Perna beds a layer of drab-coloured septaria occurs in the cliff, blocks of which also occur on the shore, containing a vein of small Paludina. about an inch in thickness, running through the centre
