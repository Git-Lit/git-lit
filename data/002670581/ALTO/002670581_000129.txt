CHLORITIC AND FOSSILIFEROUS MARL. 91 labourers proceed further into the side of the hill they are obliged to remove the upper crust of loam and limestone, which is from six to ten feet in thickness, before they can arrive at the fossil strata. The land is in the possession of Mr. William Henry Dawes, and we are informed that the parties have agreed to pay him per acre for liberty to turn over the surface and extract the fossils ! We have been in formed that this same stratum extends to Ventnor, and shows itself on Bembridge Down. We have not yet met with a practical chemist who can explain its component parts, but we suspect it will be found to contain a portion of phosphate of lime, and that it will form the principal ingredient in the manufacture of artificial manures. That it is of considerable value, no one can doubt who has witnessed the cost of pro curing it ; and we invite a controversy on its merits, as we cannot help feeling somewhat chagrined that this interesting discover}- should have been made by utter strangers, who are likely-, if there be a profit attending it, to reap the benefit thereof."
