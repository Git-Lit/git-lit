SANDOWN BAY. 13 of the slabs, which split readily, and the shells are exposed in relief on their surfaces. The most favourable time to visit Sandown Bay is, as at Brook, at the beginning of the ebb tide, and after a storm. On the floor of the strand, as well as the shore, isolated vertebræ and other detached bones occur, and are often found associated with pieces of lignite and fragments of silicified wood. The stems of a plant allied to Zamia, and bones of the Iguanodon, have also been found in the Bay, eastward of the new Fort. Further east, at the junction of the Lower Green sand with the Wealden, the Perna beds are seen rest ing on the Weald clays, as at Atherfield Point and Compton Bay. " The Wealden at the south-west of the Island passes inland, constituting the low grounds of Thorn Cross, Marsh Green, Mottistone, and Brixton, and meets the coast at Compton Grange, Brook, and Sudmore Chines. Ac the former a similar section to that of Sandown Bay is exposed. The extremity of Brook Point is about one mile from the rise of the Wealden, under Afton Down, where the strata have a much more vertical direction than at its eastern limit, following the direc tion of the superincumbent strata before described. The total thickness of the Wealden is stated to average 2,000 feet. It has been traced about 200 miles, from west to east, — from Lulworth Cove, to near Boulogne, in France ; and about 220 miles from north-west to south-east, — from Whitchurch, in Buckinghamshire, to Beauvois, in France. The Wealden of Hanover and Westphalia has been shown to correspond so closely, not only in its organic remains, but also in its litho logical character, with the English, that Sir Charles
